he is enrolled to another corps, if the conditions of enrolment so permit.  Under this rule, an
enrolled person may be transferred to any corps or department by order of an authority
exercising powers not less than of an officer commanding a division if the Central

Chunk 23:
2.
The discharge of a person, validly sanctioned by a competent authority, may, with

who sanctioned the discharge either without any conditions or subject to such conditions as
such discharged person accepts.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 24:
1.
See notes 2 and 3 to AA. s. 22.  For the prescribed authorities competent to
authorize discharge see AR 13 and table annexed thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 25:
2.
The discharge of a person who is under the conditions of his enrolment entitled to
be discharged must be authorized by the competent authority and completed with all
convenient speed by the proper authorities.  See ARs 13 and 18.  Until the person’s
discharge is completed, he remains subject to AA but any undue delay in carrying out the
discharge would give him good ground for complaint.

Chunk 26:
12.

A CO who considers it desirable to retain on the active list a JCO or WO who is
desirous of continuing to serve beyond the date on which he would ordinarily be retired,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 37:
2.
When  compulsory  discharge  of  a  JCO  or  WO  or   OR  is  sought  on  grounds of

failure to establish the charges, and that further retention in service of the individual is
undesirable.
In all cases of discharge under items 1 (III), II (iii) or III(v) competent authority
sanctioning the same must, if the circumstances of the case permit, give the person
concerned an opportunity to show cause against the order of discharge.

within the time or extended time specified in respect of that examination or course, the
Chief of the Army Staff shall call upon the officer to show cause why he should not be
compulsory retired or removed from the service.
(2)
In the event of the explanation being considered by the Chief of the Army Staff to be
unsatisfactory, the matter shall be submitted to the Central Government for orders,
together with the Officer’s explanation and the recommendation of the Chief of the Army
Staff as to whether the officer should be -
(a)
called upon to retire; or
(b)
called upon to resign.
(3)
The Central Government, after considering the explanation, if any, of the officer and
the recommendation of the Chief of the Army Staff, may call upon the officer to retire or

the service on pension or gratuity, if any, admissible to him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 44:
14.
Termination of service by the Central Government on account of misconduct.
(1)
When it is proposed to terminate the service of an officer under Section 19 on
account of misconduct, he shall be given an opportunity to show cause in the manner
specified in sub-rule (2) against such action :-
Provided that this sub-rule shall not apply:-
(a)
where the service is terminated on the ground of conduct which has led to
his conviction by a criminal court; or
(b)
where the Central Government is satisfied that for reasons, to be recorded
in writing, it is not expedient or reasonably practicable to give to the officer an
opportunity of showing cause.
(2)
When after considering the reports on an officer’s misconduct, the Central
Government or the Chief of the Army Staff is satisfied that the trial of the officer by a court-
martial is inexpedient or impracticable, but is of the opinion, that the further retention of
the said officer in the service is undesirable, the Chief of the Army Staff shall so inform the
officer together with all reports adverse to him and he shall be called upon to submit, in
writing, his explanation and defence.
Provided that the Chief of the Army Staff may withhold from disclosure any such
report or portion thereof if, in his opinion, its disclosure is not in the interest of the security
of the State.
In the event of explanation of the officer being considered unsatisfactory by the
Chief of the Army Staff, or when so directed by the Central Government, the case shall be
submitted to the Central Government, with the officer’s defence and the recommendation
of the Chief of the Army Staff as to the termination of the officer’s service in the manner
specified in sub-rule (4).
(3)
Where, upon the conviction of an officer by a criminal court, the Central
Government or the Chief of the Army Staff considers that the conduct of the officer which
has led to his conviction renders his further retention in service undesirable, a certified copy
of the judgment of the criminal court convicting him shall be submitted to the Central
Government with the recommendation of the Chief of the Army Staff  as to the termination
of the officer’s service in the manner specified in sub-rule (4).
(4)
When submitting a case to the Central Government under the provisions of sub-rule
(2) or sub-rule (3), the Chief of the Army Staff shall make his recommendation whether the

removed from the service; or
(c)
compulsorily retired from the service.

the Chief of the Army Staff, may -
(a)
dismiss or remove the officer with or without pension or gratuity; or
(b)

admissible to him.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 45:
1.
See AA. ss. 18 and 19 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 46:
2.
Action is to be initiated under this rule when the services of an officer are to be
terminated on grounds of misconduct.  The Central Government or the COAS should be
satisfied, before initiating action, that the trial of the officer by court-martial is inexpedient
or impracticable for reasons other that probable failure to establish the charge against him,
and that his further retention in service in service is undesirable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 47:
3.
For the date from which dismissal or removal takes effect, see AR 18 and notes
thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 48:
4.
The dismissal or removal cannot be made retrospective, nor can such valid dismissal
or removal be cancelled without the person’s consent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 49:
5.
Dismissal under this rule is not a punishment as under AA. s. 71.  It merely amounts
to termination of an officer’s commission/service without his consent.  Removal is a less
grievous form of dismissal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 50:
6.
No show cause notice is required to be given to an officer under this rule if his
dismissal/removal is sought on grounds of misconduct for which he has already been
convicted by a Criminal Court.  Whereas an officer convicted by a court-martial for
misconduct, must be given the show cause notice except when the Central Government
considers it inexpedient or impracticable to do so as stipulated in proviso (b) to sub-rule (1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 51:
15.
Termination of Service by the Central Government on grounds other than misconduct.
(1)
When the Chief of the Army Staff is satisfied that an officer is unfit to be retained in
the service due to inefficiency, or physical disability, the officer -
(a)
shall be so informed.
(b)
shall be furnished with the particulars of all matters adverse to him, and
(c)
shall be called upon to urge any reasons he may wish to put forward in
favour of his retention in the service;
Provided that clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall not apply if the Central
Government is satisfied that for reasons, to be recorded by it in writing, it is not
expedient or reasonable practicable to comply with the provisions thereof :
Provided further that the Chief of the Army Staff may not furnish to the
officer any matter adverse to him, if in his opinion, it is not in the interest of the
security of the State to do so.
(2)
In the event of the explanation being considered by the Chief of the Army Staff
unsatisfactory, the matter shall be submitted to the Central Government for orders,
together with the officer’s explanation and the recommendation of the Chief of the Army
Staff as to whether the officer should be -
(a)
called upon to retire; or
(b)
called upon to resign.
(3)
The central Government after considering the reports, the explanation, if any, of the
officer and the recommendation of the Chief of the Army Staff, may call upon the officer to
retire or resign, and on his refusing to do so, the officer may be compulsorily retired or
removed from the service on pension or gratuity, if any admissible to him.

conviction by a criminal court or a court martial, no person shall be dismissed or removed under sub-
section (1) or sub-section (3), of section 20, unless he has been informed of the particulars of the
cause of action against him and allowed reasonable time to state in writing any reasons he may have
to urge against his dismissal or removal from the service.
Provided that if in the opinion of the officer competent to order the dismissal or removal, it
is not expedient or reasonably practicable to comply with the provisions of this rule, he may, after
certifying to that effect, order the dismissal or removal without complying with the procedure set
out in his rule.  All cases of dismissal or removal under this rule where the prescribed procedure has
not been complied with shall be reported to the Central Government.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 66:
1.
A show cause notice is required to be given under this rule to the individual whose
dismissal or removal from service is contemplated, except when the authority competent to
order such dismissal or removal considers it inexpedient or impracticable to give such notice
as stipulated in the proviso to the rule.
Show cause notice will not be necessary when  the dismissal or removal is sought on
grounds of misconduct for which the person has already been convicted by a criminal court
or court-martial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 67:
2.
When a dismissal or removal of a person is sought on grounds of misconduct for
which he has not been convicted by a criminal court or a court-martial, the authority
competent to order such dismissal or removal should satisfy itself that trial by court-martial
of such a person is inexpedient or impracticable for reasons other than probable failure to
establish the charge, and that further retention in service of the individual is undesirable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 68:
3.
All cases of dismissal/removal under this rule where the prescribed procedure has
not been followed are to be reported to the Central Government.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 69:
18.
Date from which retirement, resignation, removal, release, discharge or dismissal
otherwise than by sentence or court-martial takes effect.

otherwise than by sentence of a court-martial is duly authorised or the discharge of a person
so subject whose discharge, if duly authorised, shall be carried out by the commanding
officer of such person with all convenient speed.  The authority competent to authorize such
dismissal or discharge may, when authorising the dismissal or discharge, specify any future
date from which it shall take effect:
Provided that if no such date is specified the dismissal or discharge shall take effect
from the date on which it was duly authorised or from the date on which the person

Chunk 70:
1.
See ARs 11 and 12 and notes thereto.  As cashiering and dismissal awarded by court-
martial, see AR 168 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 71:
2.
In the case of a person serving in India with his unit it will generally be convenient
for authorities authorising the dismissal or discharge not to specify any date but permit the
CO to relieve the person of military duty on the most convenient date.  In other cases, it may
sometimes be more convenient for the authority to specify the date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 72:
3.
The competent authority cannot make the dismissal or discharge retrospective.
Moreover, he must if he desires to specify a date, specify it at the time he authorises the
dismissal or discharge.  There is no legal objection to the “future date” being specified in
suitable cases, e.g., “date of disembarkation”; but whenever possible a precise date should
be specified.  For dismissal or discharge when out of India, see AAs. 24 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 73:
4.
If the dismissal or discharge of a person is found to be illegal, e.g., if it was not
authorised by a competent authority, that person will be entitled to pay from the date of his
illegal discharge although he performed no military duty.  Also see AR 11(2).

with in respect of that accused, the commanding officer may dispense with the procedure in
sub-rule (1).
(2)
The commanding officer shall dismiss a charge brought before him, if, in his opinion,
the evidence does not show that an offence under the Act has been committed, and may do

Chunk 81:
1.
For procedure in the case of an officer, see AR 25.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 82:
2.
Under AA. s. 135 police and other civilian witnesses may be summoned to attend
before a CO if it is considered desirable to compel their attendance by the service of a
summons.  Witnesses cannot be sworn or affirmed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 83:
3.
As to procedure where a criminal court and court-martial have each jurisdiction in
respect of a civil offence, see AA.ss. 125 and 126 and notes thereto and AR 197-A.  See also
Regs Army para 418.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 84:
4.
Every offence which a person subject to AA can commit, is an offence under the said
Act, because it is either a military offence specified in the Act or a civil offence under AA. s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 85:
69.
In deciding whether a charge under AA.s. 63 should be proceeded with, the CO must
consider whether the alleged offence is prejudicial to good order and military discipline; if in
his opinion, it is not, the charge must be dismissed.  He must also consider whether having
regard to the limitation of time prescribed by AA.s.122, the accused is liable to be proceeded
against.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 86:
5.
The CO must dismiss the charge of there is no evidence of any offence under the AA
having been committed or if the accused has been previously acquitted or convicted of the
alleged offence by any court, military or civil, or has been summarily dealt with under
sections 80, 83, 84 or 85 or the charge has previously been dismissed AA.s. 121 and AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 87:
53(1)(a).  He may dismiss it, if he considers that the evidence is doubtful or the case is trivial,
or, in the exercise of the discretion, for any reason, e.g., the good character of the accused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 88:
6.
No particular time is fixed within which a CO must dispose of a case, so that he can
always carefully consider a difficult case but as a rule he should decide immediately, and
should never delay or more than a day, unless further evidence is required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 89:
7.
To make an entry against a person without punishment is a summary disposal and
not a dismissal of the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 90:
9.
Except as provided in AR 25 a summary of evidence is to be made in every case
where it is intended to remand the accused for trial by a GCM or DCM or where the accused
is an officer, JCO or WO, for summary disposal of the charge under AA. ss. 83, 84 or 85.  In
the case of SCM, a summary of evidence need not be made, if it is intended to try the
accused forthwith without reference to superior authority either because the charge admits
of this or because of such grave necessity as is referred to in proviso (b) to AR 22(3).  The
offences which a CO must (except in case of grave necessity falling under the above proviso)
refer to superior authority before ordering trial by SCM are detailed in AA.s. 120(2).  All
other offences can be tried by SCM without such reference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 91:
10.
The summary of evidence, or a true copy thereof, should accompany the application
for a GCM, DCM or summary disposal by a superior authority, or for sanction to hold a SCM
when such sanction is necessary.

Chunk 92:
11.
A person subject to AA has no right to elect to be tried by court-martial, except as
provided in AA.s. 84(a).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 93:
12.

under AA.s.80 and which he can award.  A term of imprisonment or detention awarded by a
CO should be awarded in days and will commence to run from the day of award.  In law (in
the absence of any special provision), there is no division of a day, and therefore, however
late in the day a prisoner is committed, his term of imprisonment or detention is considered
to have commenced at the first minute of that day that is, the first minute after midnight.
The sentence will therefore, begin on the first minute of the day of award and end at sunset
of the day it expires.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 94:
13.
The award is considered final when the accused has been removed from the
presence of the CO.  The CO can at any time diminish the punishment before its completion,
though he cannot add to it.

Chunk 96:
23.
Procedure for taking down the summary of evidence.
(1)
Where the case is adjourned for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to
writing, at the adjourned hearing evidence of the witnesses who were present and gave
evidence before the commanding officer, whether against or for the accused, and of any
other person whose evidence appears to be relevant, shall be taken down in writing in the
presence and hearing of the accused before the commanding officer or such officer as he
directs.
(2)
The accused may put in cross-examination such question as he thinks fit to any
witness, and the questions together with the answers thereto shall be added to the evidence
recorded.
(3)
The evidence of each witness after it has been recorded as provided in the rule
when taken down, shall be read over to him, and shall be signed by him, or if he cannot
write his name shall be attested by the mark and witnessed as a token of the correctness of
the evidence recorded.  After all the evidence against the accused has been recorded, the
accused will be asked; “Do you wish to make any statement?  You are obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and
may be given in evidence”.  Any statement thereupon made by the accused shall be taken
down and read over to him, but he will not be cross-examined upon it.  The accused may
then call his witnesses, including if he so desires, any witnesses as to character.
(4)
The evidence of the witnesses and the statement (if any) of the accused shall be
recorded in the English language.  If the witness or accused, as the case may be, does not
understand the English language, the evidence or statement, as recorded, shall be
interpreted to him in a language which he understands.
(5)
If a person cannot be compelled to attend as a witness, or if owing to the exigencies
of service or any other grounds (including the expense and loss of time involved), the
attendance of any witness cannot in the opinion of the officer taking the summary (to be
certified by him in writing, be readily procured, a written statement of his evidence
purporting to be signed by him may be read to the accused and included in the summary of
evidence.
(6)
Any witness who is not subject to military law may be summoned to attend by order
under the hand of the commanding officer of the accused.  The summons shall be in the
form provided in Appendix III.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 97:
1.
The adjourned hearing for the purpose of reducing the evidence to writing should if
possible be held on the same day as the investigation.  The CO may direct another officer to
take down the evidence, but an officer who has given material evidence at the investigation
must not be appointed for this purpose.  He should be an officer of some experience and
with a good knowledge of the vernacular.  The adjutant or the accused’s squadron or
company commander, should usually be detailed (see note to AR 43).  The record of
evidence under this rule is called ‘the summary of evidence’.  The summary of evidence can
be ordered only by the CO of the accused.  See AR 23 (3)(c).  When it is recorded under the
orders of an officer other than the accused’s CO, summary disposal of a charge under AA. ss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 98:
83, 84 or 85 or the trial of the offender by GCM or DCM, on the basis of such a summary of
evidence may render the proceedings invalid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 99:
2.
Summary of evidence cannot be taken on oath or affirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 100:
3.
The accused cannot claim to be represented by counsel at the taking of summary of
evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 101:
4.
The evidence (so far as it is relevant and admissible) of every witness who gave
evidence before the CO must be taken down unless good reason renders if not reasonably
practicable to call him.  The evidence of witnesses who did not appear before the CO may
also be taken for either prosecution or defence, so long as it appears to be relevant.  In
reducing the evidence to writing immaterial statements may be omitted and all hearsay and
irrelevant matter should be excluded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 102:
5.
The accused must be allowed to put reasonable question to a witness, and especially
to put questions respecting any variance between the evidence taken down and that given
before the CO.  If the accused declines to cross-examination any witness the fact should
accordingly be stated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 103:
6.
The formal caution provided for in sub-rule (3) must be given as soon as the
evidence for the prosecution is closed.  If it is necessary to take additional summary, the
accused must again be formally cautioned before he makes any further statement.  The fact
that he was duly cautioned should be recorded in the summary.  It is advisable to have an
independent witness present when the accused is cautioned and when he makes the
statement.  Such independent witness apart from the officer recording the summary, would
also be competent to prove the statement of the accused at the trial subsequently if
necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 104:
7.
The statement of an accused person can only be given in evidence at the trial if it is
voluntary.  If it was made voluntarily, the mere fact that the caution was not given will not
prevent it being used as evidence, but in no case must he be authoritatively called on to
account for his proceedings, or required to make any statement, or cross-questions will not
be admissible in evidence against him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 105:
8.
The accused may call witnesses on his behalf, and their evidence will be taken down
and included in the summary; but he is not bound to call a witness because such witness
gave evidence before the CO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 106:
9.
The certificate referred to in sub-rule (5) can conveniently be written below the
signature of the absent witness on his written statement or abstract of evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 107:
10.
In many cases, the provisions of sub-rule (5) will effect a saving of time and expense,
e.g., where a civilian witness is required to prove some fact not really in dispute.  Such
witness must, however, attend in person at the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 108:
11.
If it is found necessary to call at the trial some witness for the prosecution whose
evidence is not included in the summary, an abstract of the evidence to be given by him
should be supplied to the accused as early as possible.  See AR 135 and notes thereto.

Chunk 112:
24.
Remand of accused.
(1)
The evidence and statement (if any) taken down in writing in pursuance of rule 23
(hereinafter referred to as the “summary of evidence”), shall be considered by the
commanding officer, who thereupon shall either -
(a)
remand the accused for trial by a court-martial: or
(b)
refer to case to the proper superior military authority; or
(c)
if he thinks it desirable, re-hear the case and either dismiss the charge or
dispose o
of it summarily.
(2)
If the accused is remanded for trial by a court-martial, the commanding officer shall
without unnecessary delay either assemble a summary court martial (after referring to the
officer empowered to convene a district court-martial or on active service a summary
general court-martial when such reference is necessary or apply to the proper military
authority to convene a court-martial, as the case may require.

Chunk 114:
2.
For power to dispense with this rule, see AR 36.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 115:
3.
The evidence in the summary may not correspond with that given at the original
investigation and the case may appear in a new aspect.  The CO may, therefore, decide to re-
hear the case, and, if he thinks fit, dispose it of summarily or try it by SCM, if he has
jurisdiction to do so.  He can dismiss the case on re-hearing it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 116:
4.
Where precise information as to the locality of the offence is likely to be of use in
understanding a case, a plan drawn to scale should accompany a summary of evidence
submitted to superior authority.  If it is considered necessary that matters of evidence
should be shown on this plan, (e.g., place where the body was found in a murder case, or
position of accused or a witness) the plan should be in duplicate, and these matters should
only appear on one copy, if the plan is subsequently produced at the trial, the unmarked
copy will be used, being put in and sworn/affirmed to by the person who made it.  These
matters of evidence will then (if necessary) be marked on it, in accordance with the evidence
given at the trial, and a note to that effect made in the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 117:
5.
Vernacular documents attached to a summary of evidence should be accompanied
by a translation in English.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 118:
6.
The delay in assembling a SCM should be avoided. The accused should be warned
for trial at least 96 hours before hand, except on active service when he should be so
warned at least 24 hours before the trial commences,  See AR 34 and notes thereto.

Summary disposal of charges against Officer, Junior Commissioned Officer or Warrant
Officer.
(1)
Where an officer, a junior commissioned officer or a warrant officer is remanded for
the disposal of a charge against him by an authority empowered under section 83, 84 or 85
to deal summarily with that charge, the summary of evidence shall be delivered to him, free
of charge, with a copy  of the charge as soon as practicable after its preparation and in any
case not less than twenty for hours before the disposal.
(2)
Where the authority empowered under section 83, 84 or 85 decides to deal
summarily with a charge against an officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer,
he shall unless he dismisses the charge, or unless the accused has consented in writing to
dispense with the attendance of the witnesses, hear the evidence in the presence of the
accused.  The accused shall have full liberty to cross-examine any witness against him, and
to call any witnesses and make a statement in his defence.
(3)
The proceedings shall be recorded as far as practicable in accordance with the form
in Appendix IV and in every case in which punishment is awarded, the proceedings together
with the conduct sheet, summary of evidence and written consent to dispense with the
attendance of witnesses (if any) of the accused, shall be forwarded through the proper
channel to the superior military authority as defined in section 88.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 121:
1.
The accused should be warned for trial at least 24 hours before his summary trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 122:
2.
An authority can dispose of the case summarily not only if asked to do so, but also if
he is asked to convene a court-martial for the trial of the offender.  Even if he is asked to
deal summarily with a case he can, if he thinks it desirable, convene a court-martial.  If on
perusal of the summary (or abstract) of evidence and other documents, he thinks fit, he can
at once, without bringing the accused before him order dismissal of the charge, or order a
court-martial, or he can decide to hear the evidence with a view to dealing summarily with
the case.  After hearing the evidence the authority can still dismiss the case or order a court-
martial or he can deal summarily with it but if he proposes to award a punishment of
forfeiture of seniority or service for promotion, the accused has a right to claim trial by
court-martial.  See AA.s. 84.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 123:

Form 1 in Appendix IV Part I is to be used when the accused has given his consent in
writing to dispense with attendance of witness at the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 124:
4.
The oral statement of the accused made in reply to question 4 I  Form 1 or 2, will be
recorded or a gist thereof prepared and attached.  If the accused submits a written
statement, it would be attached to the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 125:
5.
Question numbers, 5 in form 1 or Question number 6 in form 2 is to be put to an
officer, JCO or WO, if the authority proposes to award a punishment other than reprimand,
severe reprimand or stoppages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 126:
6.
See notes to form 1 and 2 regarding their disposal.  After disposal of a charge if the
finding is that of guilty, the form accompanied by the conduct sheet (IAFF-3013), in
duplicate, summary or abstract of evidence, statement of the accused and written consent
of the accused is to be forwarded through the usual channels to the Headquarters of the
command concerned, who will show them to the DJAG of the command.  In the case of
punishments awarded by GOC-in-C of a command, these documents will be forwarded to
the AG’s Branch (PS-1) at Army Headquarters.  When the finding is that of not guilty, only
the finding will be communicated to Headquarters command concerned in the case of JCOs
& WOs, and to Army Headquarters in the case of officers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 127:
7.
In the case of JCOs and WOs, the form together with the summary of evidence,
statement of the accused and written consent of the accused is required to be returned to
the unit for attachment to his Regimental conduct sheet (IAFF-3013).

Delay reports.
(1)
In every case where a person subject to the Act, who is not on active service, is in
military custody for a period longer that eight days without a court-martial for his trial
having been ordered to assemble, or without a punishment having been awarded him under
section 80, the commanding officer shall make a report in the form specified in Appendix III
to the officer empowered to convene a general or a district court-martial for the trial of such
person.  Such report shall be made to the authority mentioned in this rule at intervals of
every eight days until a court-martial is ordered to assemble, or a punishment is awarded
under section 80, or such person is released from custody as the case may be.
(2)
A copy of every such report made on or after the forty-eighth day of such custody
shall be sent by the commanding officer direct to the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the
command in which such person is held in custody.
(3)
(i)
Detention in military custody beyond two months of a person subject to the
Act, who is not on active service and in whose case a court-martial for trial has not
been ordered to assemble, shall require the sanction of the Chief of the Army Staff,
or any officer authorised by him in this behalf with the approval of the Central
Government, who may sanction further detention for a specific period, which he
may extend from time to time, subject to a total period of detention of three
months.
(ii)
Any such detention beyond a period of three months shall require the
approval of the Central Government.
ORDER
AUTHORISATION TO SANCTION DETENTION IN MILITARY CUSTODY
OF PERSONS SUBJECT TO THE ARMY ACT BEYOND TWO MONTHS
UNDER ARMY RULE 27(3)
In pursuance of clause (i) of sub rule 27 of the Army Rules, 1954 and in supersession
of
order dated 12th September, 1983 issued in this behalf, the Chief of Army Staff, with the
aproval of the Central Government, hereby authorizes the General Officer Commanding-in-
Chief of the commands to sanction in military custody beyond two months of a person
subject to the Army Act, 1950, including an officer or a Junior Commissioned Officer, who is
not on active service and in whose case a Court Martial for trial has not been ordered to
assemble.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 136:
4.
Detention in custody beyond 2 months of a person who is not on active
service and in whose case a court-martial is not ordered to assemble, requires the
sanction of the sanction of the Central Government.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 137:
5.
Once a court-martial has been ordered to assemble, e.g., a convening order
is issued, the sanction of the COAS or the Central Government will not be necessary.
The requirement of the rule for obtaining sanction should not be circumvented by
issue of a convening order far in advance of the date of trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 138:
6.
If necessary an accused person may be released from arrest without
prejudice to his re-arrest, if trial cannot be convened within 2 or 3 months.  If his
detention beyond a period of two or three months is considered necessary, steps
should be taken to obtain the sanction well in advance.  An accused person should
not be kept in such detention in anticipation of a sanction.  Detaining an accused in
custody beyond two or three months without a sanction, makes such detention
illegal and a post-facto sanction obtained would not render such detention legal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 139:
7.
Under AR 33(6), an accused person has a right to address a petition to the
DJAG or AJAG of the command concerned if he is kept in custody longer that 48 days
without being brought to trial or is not given full liberty  for preparing his defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 140:

Unnecessary detention in custody of an accused without bringing him to
trial amounts to an offence under AA.s. 50(a).

Charge-sheet and charge.
(1)
A charge-sheet shall contain the whole issue or issues to be tried by a court-martial
at one time.
(2)
A charge means a accusation contained in a charge-sheet that a person subject to
the Act has been guilty of an offence.
(3)
A charge-sheet may contain one charge or several charges.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 142:
1.
The charge-sheet is usually prepared by the CO or adjutant of the accused’s unit; but
in the case of a trial by GCM or DCM, AR 37 makes the convening officer equally responsible
for its correctness.  It must be signed by the officer in actual command of the unit to which
the accused belongs.  If the accused is attached to another unit, the charge-sheet must be
signed by the CO of the unit to which he is so attached.  The order for the trial must be
endorsed at the foot of the charge-sheet cannot be endorsed for trial by a staff officer as
such.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 143:
2.
For submission of certain charges to DJAG or AJAG of the command concerned
before trial, see Regs Army para 458.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 144:
3.
There may be several charge-sheets (see AR 79), but the court can only deal with
one charge-sheet at a time.  When there are two or more charge-sheet, they must be
consecutively numbered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 145:
4.
The “charge” referred to in this rule is the formal written charge upon which the
accused is to be tried as distinct from the charge or complaint mentioned in AA.s. 101 and
ARs 22, 23 and25, which give rise to the preliminary investigation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 146:
5.
All charges, includes the alternative charges, must be consecutively numbered.  As
to insertion of charges in separate charge-sheets see AR 79 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 147:
6.
An alternative charge should not be preferred, where a special finding is possible
under AA.s. 139 e.g., on a charge of desertion there is no need to prefer a charge of absence
without leave as an alternative.  See AA.s. 139(a).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 148:
29.
Commencement of charge-sheet.  Every charge-sheet shall begin with the name and
description of the pension charged, and state his number, rank, name and the corps or department
(if any) to which he belongs.  When the accused person does not belong to the regular Army, the
charge-sheet shall show by the description of him, or directly by an express averment, that he is
subject to the Act in respect of the offence charged.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 149:
1.
The name or description of a person charged is immaterial so long as the identity is
established.  See also notes to ARs 32(1), 50(1) and 113.  As an officer, JCO, WO or person
enrolled in the regular Army is always subject to AA, a statement in the description of the
accused that he belongs to a corps of the regular Army will be sufficient to aver and
evidence of his so belonging will be sufficient to prove that he is subject to AA, without
expressly adding the words.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 150:
2.
If the accused is subject to AA under specified conditions e.g., an enrolled person of
the Territorial Army , the description must contain an averment as to how he is subject of
AA.  See specimen charge-sheet ‘Description of the accused’ serials 6 to 8 at page 357 for
persons who are subject of AA under specified conditions.  See AA.s. 2(1) clauses (d) to (i).

Contents of charge.
(1)
Each charge shall state one offence only, and in no case shall an offence be
described in the alternative in the same charge.
(2)
Each charge shall be divided into two parts -
(a)
statement of the offence; and
(b)
statement of the particulars of the act, neglect or omission constituting the
offence.
(3)
The offence shall be stated, if not a civil offence, as nearly as practicable, in the
words of the Act, and if a civil offence, in such words as sufficiently describe in technical
words.
(4)
The particulars shall state such circumstances respecting the alleged offence as will
enable the accused to know what act, neglect or omission is intended to be proved against
him as constituting the offence.
(5)
The particulars in one charge may be framed wholly or partly by a reference to the
particulars in another charge, and in that case so much of the latter particulars as are so
referred to shall be deemed to form part of the first mentioned charge as well as of the
other charge.
(6)
Where it is intended to prove any facts in respect of which any deduction from pay
and allowances can be awarded as a consequence of the offence charged, the particulars
shall state those facts and the sum of the loss or damage it is intended to charge.

Chunk 154:

For forms of charges and preliminary note as to their use, see pages 357 to 360.  See
also memoranda for guidance of courts-martial at page 430.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 155:
2.
The convening officer or in the case of trial by SCM, the CO should seek the advice of
DJAG or AJAG of the command concerned in any case where doubt exists as to the manner
in which the charge should be framed.  Charges for trial by GCsM and for indecency, fraud,
theft (except ordinary theft) and civil offences (except simple assaults) should be referred to
DJAG or AJAG concerned before trail;  See Regs Regs Army para 458.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 156:
3.
A single charge disclosing two separate offences would be bad for duplicity e.g., a
charge under AA.s. 40 for using threatening language and insubordinate language to his
superior officer or a charge under AA.s. 52 for committing theft of Government property and
dishonestly retaining Government property.  But the use of the word “and” in the statement
of offence is permissible where the charge discloses only one offence e.g, and charge under
AA.s. 54(b) for losing by neglect arms, equipment and clothing the property of the
Government because an accused is not charged with two offences, but with a single offence
which is constituted by his having lost by neglect the various articles specified in the charge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 157:
4.
The rule against duplicity is also applicable to the particulars of the charge e.g., in a
charge under AA.s. 36(d) an averment that the accused left his post without orders form his
superior officer and remained absent for a specified period, is not permissible as the
particulars disclose two separate offences.  Similarly in a charge under AA.s. 44, it is not
permissible to aver two false answers to two separate questions set forth in the enrolment
form or in a charge under AA.s. 40(e) to aver two separate instances of use of insubordinate
language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 158:
5.
The incidental mention of a separate offence in the particulars, however, would not
of itself invalidate the charge e.g., the mention in the particulars of a charge under AA.s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 159:
40(a) for assaulting his superior officer, use of insubordinate language chargeable under
AA.s. 40(c)  which accompanied a menacing gesture and showed its purport.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 160:
6.
A single transaction, though technically disclosing more that one offence, should
not, as a rule be made the subject of more that one charge.  For instance, where use of
criminal force to a superior officer is accompanied by insubordinate language, the use of
criminal force alone should be charged (assuming the evidence to be satisfactory), the
language being admissible in evidence as to the intent.  On the other hand, if it seems
desirable, a man can legally be charged in two separate charges with escape from arrest and
absence without leave (following such escape).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 161:
7.
The statement of particulars must support the statement of the offence; e.g., if the
statement of an offence laid under AA.s.52(a) alleged that the accused committed theft in
respect of property of the Government, particulars stating that the accused dishonestly
received, or was in unauthorized possession of, the property would not support the
statement of the offence and the charge would be a bad charge, and the fact that the
accused pleaded guilty to it would not affect the matter.  But a merely technical difference,
e.g., where the word assault is used in the statement of offence and the particulars disclose
the use of criminal force, would not invalidate the charge, if the statement of offence and
the particulars taken together supply the court and the accused with sufficient information
of the nature of the offence which the court is to try and the accused to meet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 162:
8.
Where the statement of offence discloses an offence under AA and one or more
essential elements of that offence are omitted from the particulars e.g., the word
“dishonestly” in a charge of “dishonestly misappropriating” or the words “knowing it to be
stolen” in a charge of receiving  the omission of that element from the particulars would not
invalidate the charge, if taken as a whole, it informs the accused of the allegations he is
called upon to meet, and the offence for which he is arraigned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 163:
9.
When an offence is punished more severely, when committed under particular
circumstances, the particulars should contain an averment about  such circumstances; e.g.,
in a charge under AA.s. 41(2) for disobeying a lawful command of his superior officer an
averment to the effect that the offence was committed when on active service, should be
made, where necessary, since the said offence when committed on active service is more
severely punished that otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 164:
10.
The exact or approximate date of the offence should be averred in the particulars.
Such averment would prima-facie show whether or not the trial in respect of the offence is
time barred.  See AA.s. 122(1) and the notes thereto.  If for reasons of security it is
considered undesirable to disclose the place of offence, the words “at field” may be averred
in the particulars instead of the actual place of offence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 165:
11.
When civil offences are tried by court-martial under AA.s. 69, although technical
terms need not be used in the charge, the essence of the civil offence must be expressed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 166:
12.
The statement of particulars should state shortly in ordinary language what the
accused is alleged to have done.  All the ingredients necessary to constitute the offence
should be specified, e.g., if the charge is under AA.s. 41(2) for disobeying a lawful command,
the particulars must state the command, rank and name of the superior officer who gave the
command, and the fact that the accused disobeyed it.  Whether a state of mind e.g.,
intention or knowledge, is an essential ingredient of an offence, such state of mind should
be averred in the particulars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 167:
13.
Vague statement must be avoided, e.g., in a charge for using insubordinate language
to his superior officer or for making a false statement to his CO, it is not sufficient to state
that the accused used insubordinate language or made a false statement well knowing the
statement to be false; the words alleged to have been spoken or written must be set out in
the particulars.  Similarly in a charge under AA.s. 42(e) it is not sufficient to state that the
accused neglected to obey battalion orders by doing a particular act; the order it is alleged
the accused neglected to obey must be set out in the particulars.  See specimen charge No
………….. on page……………

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 168:
14.
When particulars in one charge are framed wholly or partially by reference to the
particulars in another charge and the accused is convicted of the former but acquitted of the
latter, the conviction when recorded should specify the place and date mention in the
former charge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 169:
15.
Stoppages cannot be awarded under AA.s. 71(1) unless particulars contain a specific
averment regarding the value of the loss or damage caused and proved in evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 170:
31.
Signature on charge-sheet.   The charge-sheet shall be signed by the commanding officer of
the accused and shall contain the place and date of such signature.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 171:
1.
See note 1 to AR 28.  The charge-sheet must be signed by the CO of the accused.  It
cannot be signed by any other officer for him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 172:
2.
For CO see AA.s. 3(v).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 173:
3.
The charge–sheet should contain the place and date of signature.  If for reasons of
security it is inadvisable to disclose the place of signature, it may be shown as “field”.  The
date of signature is of assistance in ascertaining whether or not provision of AR 34 regarding
warning of the accused for trial, have been complied with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 174:
32.
Validity of charge-sheet.
(1)
A charge-sheet shall not be invalid merely by reasons of the fact that it contains any
mistake in the name or description of the person charged, provided that he does not object
to the charge-sheet during the trial, and that no substantial injustice has been done to the
person charged.
(2)
In the construction of a charge-sheet or charge, there shall be presumed in favour of
supporting the same every proposition which may reasonably be presumed to be impliedly
included though not expressed therein.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 175:
1.
Although the trial of an offender is not invalid on account of mistake in the name of
the accused, such mistakes are dangerous, in so far as they may lead to mistakes of
substance.  Where, however, a person has been enrolled and in commonly known under an
assumed name, he may be described by that name.  The court has power to amend the
charge by correcting any mistake in the name or description of an accused person ,under AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 176:
50 or 113.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 177:
2.
Sub-rule (2) must not be relied upon as an excuse for carelessness in the preparation
of charge-sheets.  This sub-rule  enables a court-martial, or any authority dealing with the
case summarily under AA.s. 80, 83, 84 or 85, to presume matters which, though not stated in
the charge are necessary to support its validity, and can reasonably be implied from it.
Preparation for defence by accused person

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 178:
33.
Rights of accused to prepare defence.
(1)
Correspondence between the accused and his legal advisers shall not be liable to be
censored.  The accused shall inform his commanding officer of the names of such advisers
and shall also inform him of any distinctive marks that such correspondence will bear.
(2)
An accused person shall have the right to interview any witnesses whom he may
wish to call in his defence.  The provision of rule 137 shall apply to procuring the attendance
of such witnesses.
(3)
If the accused so desires, the commanding officer of the accused shall take such
steps as the circumstances of the case permit to obtain a written statement from a witness
whom the accused may wish to call in his defence.  The statement shall be obtained in a
closed envelope which shall be given to the accused person unopened.
(4)
If the accused person gives to his commanding officer the name of any person whom
he wishes to call in his defence, no person shall interview such witness with reference to the
charges against the accused except in the presence of the accused, unless the accused
agrees to dispense with his presence in writing.  Similarly if the accused wishes to interview
a witness whom the prosecutor intends to all, the interview shall be in the presence of an
officer detailed by the commanding officer of the accused person.
(5)
The commanding officer of the accused person or the officer responsible for his
custody shall take adequate precautions so that no conversation which the accused person
may have with his legal advisers or witnesses is liable to be overheard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 179:
6.
The accused person shall have the right to address an application to the Deputy or
Assistant Judge Advocate General of the command within which he for the time being is, if
he is kept  under arrest longer that forty-eight days with out being brought to trial or is not
given full liberty for preparing his defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 180:
7.
As soon as practicable after an accused has been remanded for trial by a general or
district court-martial, and in any case not less than ninety-six hours or on active service
twenty-four hours before his trial, an officer shall give to him free of charge a copy of the
summary of evidence, and explain to him his rights under these rules as to preparing his
defence and being assisted or represented at the trial, and shall ask him to state in writing
whether or not he wishes to have an officer assigned by the convening officer to represent
him at the trial, if a suitable officer should be available.  The convening officer shall be
informed whether or not the accused so elects.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 181:
1.
For power to dispense with this rule see AR 36.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 182:
2.
The freest communication which is consistent with the necessities of discipline and
with the same custody of the accused should be allowed.  Failure to give the accused full
opportunity of preparing his defence, and free communication with others for the purpose,
may invalidate the proceedings.  The accused, however, or the defending officer is not
entitled to interview witnesses for the prosecution, without special authority.  When so
authorized, the accused or the defending officer should interview witnesses  for the
prosecution in the presence of an officer deputed by the CO.  An accused is not bound to call
as a witness everyone with whom he communicates as a possible witness on his behalf.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 183:
3.
Neither the accused not his defending officer or counsel should be permitted to
interview for the purpose of general examination or interrogation any witness who has
already given evidence for the prosecution at the taking of the summary of evidence, or
whose evidence is included in the abstract of evidence as a witness for the prosecution
unless the prosecution have, before the trial, definitely decided not to call such witness for
the prosecution.  If the accused or his defending officer or counsel desire to put any specific
question or questions to such a witness for the prosecution with a view to ascertaining some
specific fact or facts which it may be of assistance in the preparation of the defence to know,
the Convening officer should permit such question or questions to be put subject to any
safeguard such as the presence of a representative of the prosecution as the Convening
Officer may think fit.  The converse holds goods as regards interviews by the prosecution of
witness for the defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 184:
4.
As to defending officer and friend of the accused see AR 95; and as to counsel at
GCsM and DCsM, see ARs 96 to 101.  As to the right of the accused to consult the JA on any
question of law or procedure, see AR 105.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 185:
34.
Warning of accused for trial.
(1)
The accused before he is arraigned shall be informed by an officer of every charge
for which he is to be tried and also that, on his giving the names of witnesses whom he
desires to call in his defence reasonable steps will be taken for procuring their attendance,
and those steps shall be taken accordingly.
The interval between his being so informed and his arraignment shall not be less
that ninety-six hours or where the accused person is on active service less than twenty-four
hours.
(2)
The officer at the time of so informing the accused shall give him a copy of the
charge sheet and shall, if necessary, read and explain to him the charges brought against
him.  If the accused desires to have it in a language which he understands, a translation
thereof shall also be given to him.
(3)
The officer shall also deliver to the accused a list of the names, rank and corps (if
any) , of the officers who are to form the court, and where officers in waiting are named,
also of those officers in courts-martial other than summary courts-martial.
(4)
If it appears to the court that the accused is liable to be prejudiced at his trial by any
non-compliance with this rule, the court shall take steps and, if necessary, adjourn to avoid
the accused being so prejudiced.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 186:
1.
For power to dispense with this rule see AR 36.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 187:
2.
The duty of complying with the provisions of this rule will usually devolve upon the
CO in the case of summary and the prosecutor in the case of other courts-martial, who
should, in any case, satisfy himself before the trial that it has been properly performed.
Even if this rule is dispensed with under AR 36, the accused must have information of the
charge, and opportunity of calling his witnesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 188:
3.
As to arraignment, see AR 48 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 189:
4.
The duty of procuring attendance of witnesses at GCM and DCM devolves, under AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 190:
137(1) upon the CO or convening officer or, after assembly of the court, the presiding
officer.  The duty of procuring attendance of witnesses at SCM devolves under AR 137(2)
upon the CO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 191:
5.
The request on an accused person for witnesses to be called on his behalf should
only be refused if it is quite clear that their evidence would be immaterial, or if their
attendance cannot be secured within a reasonable time.  If the request is refused, the
refusal and reasons for it should be communicated to the court, who will deal with the
matter under sub-rule (4) and AR 138.  If an essential witness is absent, the court should
always adjourn for the purposes of enabling him to attend or of procuring his examination
on commission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 192:
6.
For form of summons to witnesses, see Appendix III, Part III.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 193:
7.
A copy and translation of the charge-sheet must always be given, unless that rule
has been dispensed with under AR 36.  Even where it is so dispensed with, the charges must
be clearly explained to the accused, as otherwise he may not have proper opportunity to
prepare his defence.  If the accused objects to the charge he will have an opportunity of
making his objection when called on to plead (AR 49).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 194:
8.
The list of names, rank and corps of the members if the court should normally be
delivered to the accused, irrespective of any demand on his part, as soon as the names of
the members are known.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 195:
35.
Joint trial of several accused persons.
(1)
Any number of accused persons may be charged jointly and tried together for an
offence averred to have been committed by them collectively.
(2)
Any number of accused persons although not charged jointly, may be tried together
for an offence averred to have been committed by one or more of them and to have been
abetted by the other or others.
(3)
Where the accused are so charged under sub-rules (1) and (2), any one or more of
them may at the same time be charged with and tried for any offence averred to have been
committed individually or collectively, provided that all the said offences are based on the
same facts, or form or are part of a series of offences of the same or similar character.
(4)
In the cases mentioned above, notice of the intention to try the accused persons
together shall be given to each of the accused at the time of his being informed of the
charges, and any accused person may claim, either by notice to the authority convening the
court or, when arraigned before the court, by notice to the court, that he or some other
accused be tried separately on one or more of the charges included in the charge-sheet, on
the ground that the evidence of one or more or the other accused persons proposed to be
tried together with him, will be material to his defence, or that otherwise he would be
prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence.  The convening authority or court, if satisfied that
the evidence will be material or that the accused may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his
defence as aforesaid, and if the nature of the charge admits of this shall allow the claim, and
such accused person, or, as the case may  be, the other accused person or persons whose
separate trial has been claimed, shall be tried separately.  Where nay such claim has been
made and disallowed by the authority convening the court, or by the court, the disallowance
of such claim will not be a ground for refusing confirmation of the finding or sentence
unless, in the opinion of the confirming authority, substantial miscarriage of justice has
occurred by reason of the disallowance of such claim.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 196:
1.
If two accused persons are charged separately with committing the same offence,
they cannot, even  at their own request, be tried together, because they have not been
charged jointly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 197:
2.
Whether a joint or a separate summary of evidence is recorded against the accused
persons, they can still be charged jointly and tried together under the circumstances
specified in this rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 198:
3.
As to swearing the court to try several accused persons, see AR 89 and notes, and as
to form of proceedings in the case of a joint trial, see para. 28 of memoranda on page 436.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 199:
4.
If one accused pleads guilty and another not guilty, the trial of the latter upto and
including the finding must be carried out before the court deals with the case of the accused
who has pleaded guilty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 200:
5.
To admit of a joint charge and trial, the accused must have acted together with the
common purpose of committing the offence charged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 201:
6.
The nature of the charge may not admit of a separate trial, e.g., in the case of
conspiring to cause or joining in a mutiny, the essence of the charge is combination between
the accused persons.  Certain offences, on the other hand, cannot from their nature, be
committed collectively, e.g., intoxication, sentry sleeping upon or leaving his post;
malingering; giving false evidence, cowardice, etc, and speaking generally, all offences where
a person’s individual state of body or mind is of the essence of the offence.  In case of doubt
the accused should be tried separately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 202:
36.
Suspension of rules on the ground of military exigencies or the necessities of discipline.
Where it appears to the officer convening a court-martial, or to the senior officer on the spot, that
military exigencies , or the necessities of discipline  render it impossible or inexpedient to observe
any of the rules 23, 24, 33 and 34 and sub-rule (2) of rule 95, he may, by order under his hand, make
a declaration to that effect specifying the nature of such exigencies or necessities, and thereupon
the trial or other proceedings shall be as valid as if the rule mentioned in such declaration had not
been contained herein; and such declaration may be made with respect of any or all of the rules
aforesaid in the case of the same court-martial:
Provided that the accused shall have full opportunity of making his defence, and shall be
afforded every facility for preparing it which is practicable, having due regard to the said exigencies
or necessities.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 203:
1.
For form of declaration see page 404.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 204:
2.
The power conferred by this rule should rarely be exercised except on active service
and then only if absolutely necessary. Occasionally it may be necessary to resort to it in the
case of embarkation or on the line of march, or possibly in an extreme case where
necessities of discipline require speedy trial and punishment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 205:
3.
In exercising the powers conferred by this rule, it is not necessary to dispense with
all the provisions mentioned, e.g.,  it may be expedient to comply with the relevant
provisions of AR 23 but not with AR 33.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 206:
4.
If AR 23 is suspended, steps must be taken to inform the accused before hand of the
nature of the charge, the names of the witnesses and the effect of their evidence, and the
court must take care that the accused is not prejudiced by reason of the suspension, as, for
instance, by not having received a summary of evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 207:
5.
The power of dispensing with AR 33 is only intended to be exercised where it is
necessary to try a person before he can communicate with a witness or friend at a distance.
The said rule should never be dispensed with except in extreme cases and even then the
accused must be allowed free communication with any witness or friend on the spot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 208:
6.
Rule 34(3) should always be complied with the sub-rules (1) and (2) of the said rule,
if not complied with within the time therein mentioned, should be complied with as long as
possible before the court assembles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 209:
7.
The accused will not have full opportunity of making his defence unless he receives
in reasonable time the information mentioned above;  and if he requests a reasonable
adjournment in order to consider the witnesses evidence; or to acquaint himself with the
charge, or requests the postponement of cross-examination of a witness, the court should
grant the request, and may adjourn for the purpose.  A refusal to do so might be held to be
non-compliance with the proviso to the rule and thus to invalidate the trial.  For the same
reason the court, even in the absence of any such request, must take care that the accused
is not prejudiced, by being taken by surprise, either by the charge or the evidence or
witnesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 210:
8.
When any of the provisions of ARs 33 or 34 have not been complied with, the
accused has a right to ask for an adjournment if he has been prejudiced by such non-
defence; see AR 56 (1) and (2).
SECTION 2 – GENERAL AND DISTRICT COURTS-MARTIAL
Convening the Court

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 211:
37.
Convening of General and District Court-Martial.
(1)
An officer before convening a general or district court-martial shall first satisfy
himself that the charges to be tried by the court are for offences within the meaning of the
Act, and that the evidence justified a trial on those charges, and if not so satisfied, shall
order the release of the accused, or refer the case to superior authority.
(2)
He shall also satisfy himself that the case is a proper one to be tried by the kind of
court-martial which he proposes to convene.
(3)
The officer convening a court-martial shall appoint or detail the officers to form the
court and, may also appoint or detail such waiting officers as he thinks expedient.  He may
also, where he considers the services of an interpreter to be necessary, appoint or detail an
interpreter to the court.
(4)
The officer convening a court-martial shall furnish to the senior member of the court
with the original charge-sheet on which the accused is to be tried and, where no judge-
advocate has been appointed, also with a copy of the summary of evidence and the order
for the assembly of the court-martial.  He shall also send, to all the other members, copies of
the charge sheet and to the judge-advocate when one has been appointed, a copy of the
charge sheet and a copy of the summary of evidence.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 212:
1.
With respect of the duties of the convening officer, see paras 10 to 13 of
memoranda at page 440 to 441.  The convening officer must ensure that he holds the
necessary court-martial warrant empowering him to convene the description of court
martial that he considers appropriate.  A court martial convened by an officer who is not
empowered to do so will lack jurisdiction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 213:
2.
Where the convening officer finds it impracticable to follow the ordinary rules as to
appointing members from different corps (AR 40(1), or as to the rank of members (AR 40(2),
he should state his opinion in the convening order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 214:
3.
The declaration as to military exigencies dispensing with certain rules (AR 36),
should be in a separate order.  For form of declaration see page 398.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 215:
4.
Under AA.s. 117(1) a court-martial which, after commencement of the trial, is
reduced below the legal minimum, is dissolved.  If, therefore, the trial is likely to be
prolonged, the number of members detailed to serve should be in excess of the legal
minimum required.  Additional members should also be detailed to serve in doubtful or
complicated cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 216:
5.
It will usually be desirable, in the case of both GCM and DCM to add two or more
waiting members, in order to fill the places of officers retiring on challenge or unable to
attend owing to illness, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 217:
6.
In almost every case an interpreter in the language of the accused person will be
necessary and should be detailed; see AR 91 and note.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 218:
7.
Where several persons are to be tried separately by the same court, a copy of
convening order should be prepared for each accused.  The original charge-sheet and
convening order will subsequently be annexed to the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 219:
8.
The object of sub-rule (4) is to enable the presiding officer and members of the
court-martial to have an idea of the charge/charges on which the accused is to be arraigned.
If any amendment to the charge(s) is considered necessary by the presiding officer, he
should communicate his views to the convening officer before the trial begins.  Only when a
JA is not appointed, a copy of the summary or abstract of evidence and convening order is to
be sent to the presiding officer.  A copy of the summary of evidence or abstract of evidence
sent to the presiding officer should have the portions of evidence which being inadmissible
or irrelevant, are not being led at the trial, completely expurgated.  The JA is responsible to
inform the convening officer of any informality or defect in the charge or in the constitution
of the court; see AR 105(3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 220:
9.
The summary or abstract of evidence must be read in court if the accused pleads
guilty, and may be used for determining the sentence.  (AR 54(3)).  It may be used at the trial
for the purpose of showing that a witness had previously made a particular statement, or is
giving evidence which differs from that given by him when the summary was taken.  Any
statement of the accused contained in the summary may be read to the court as evidence at
the close of the prosecution case, but before reading such statement formal proof should be
given that it was made voluntarily; see AR 23 (3).  Except in the above instances, the
summary cannot be used as evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 221:
10.
During the trial the presiding officer should compare the evidence given by each
witness with his statement contained in the summary of evidence and, if there is any
material variation, should question him thereon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 222:
11.
Members of the court must take care that they are not unduly influenced by any
statement appearing in the summary of evidence, through they will naturally have regard in
testing the credibility of a witness, to the fact that his evidence given at the trial is
contradictory to his statement at the summary.  It is usually expedient that the presiding
officer alone should refer to the summary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 223:
12.
Where the accused pleads guilty, the summary of evidence is to be annexed to the
proceedings (AR 54(3) and form of proceedings at page 404).  If the accused pleads “not
guilty”, the summary should be enclosed with the proceedings when sent to the confirming
officers, but it should only be annexed to the proceedings if it has been used in evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 224:
13.
As to an “abstract of evidence”, see AR 25(2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 225:
38.
Adjournment for insufficient number of officers.
(1)
If, before the accused is arraigned, the full number of officers detailed are not
available to serve, by reason of no-eligibility, disqualification, challenge or otherwise, and if
there are not a sufficient number of officers in waiting to take the place of those unable to
serve, the court shall ordinarily adjourn for purpose of fresh members being appointed, but
if the court is of opinion that in the interest of justice, and for the good of the service, it is
inexpedient so to adjourn, it may, if not reduced in number below the legal minimum,
proceed, after recording their reasons for so doing.
(2)
If the court adjourns for the purpose of the appointment of fresh members, whether
under these rules or otherwise the convening officer may, if he thinks fit, convene another
court.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 226:
1.
A GCM for which, say, seven members have been detailed, should not ordinarily
begin the trial with less that seven.  It may be assumed that the convening officer, in
detailing seven members  when five would have legally sufficed, had in view the possible
prolongation of the trial or the desirability, in the circumstances of the case, of submitting
the issues to be decided to the arbitration of a larger tribunal.  But under this rule, the court
may proceed, unless reduced below the legal minimum (see notes to AR 37).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 227:
2.
No court can be formed if the number of officers is, from whatever cause, below the
legal minimum, nor can the proceedings even, if properly commenced, be continued.  In
either case a report of the circumstances must be made to the convening officer by the
senior officer present.  For legal minimum, see AA.ss. 113 and 114.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 228:
3.
After the trial has once  begun, fresh members cannot be appointed in any
circumstances.  See AA.s. 117 (1).  The trial is said to have commenced with the accused is
arraigned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 229:
39.
Ineligibility and disqualification of officers for court-martial.
(1)
An officer is not eligible for serving on a court-martial if he is not subject to the Act.
(2)
An officer is disqualified for serving on a general or district court-martial if he -
(a)
is an officer who convened the court; or
(b)
is the prosecutor or a witness for the prosecution; or
(c)
investigated the charges before trial, or took town the summary of
evidence, or was a member of a court of inquiry respecting the matters on which the
charges against the accused are founded, or was the squadron, battery, company, or
other commander, who made preliminary inquiry into the case, or was a member of
a previous court-martial which tried the accused in respect of the same offence; or
(d)
is the commanding officer of the accused, or the corps to which the accused
belongs; or
(e)
has a personal interest in the case.
(3)
The provost-martial or assistant provost-marshal is disqualified from serving on a
general
court-martial or district court-martial.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 230:
1.
The term “eligible” is used with reference to an officer being subject to AA and of
the necessary standing; that is to say, it refers to the status of the officer, and involves no
personal considerations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 231:
2.
The term “disqualified” is used with reference to the personal qualification of an
officer.  Except so far as is provided by AR 40, the corps to which an officer belongs is
immaterial as regards his eligibility or qualification to serve on a court-martial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 232:
3.
The term “personal interest”  will extent to even a remote or very small interest,
e.g., in a charge relating to the theft of a sum of money, however small, belonging to an
officers’ mess, or a club, every officer of that mess or club has a personal interest, and is
therefore disqualified.  A merely technical interest has been held to disqualify a person from
holding a judicial position, e.g., a person who holds, as trustee or otherwise on  behalf of
others money in which he has no beneficial share himself, nevertheless has a personal
interest in any charge relating to that money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 233:
4.
An officer should not be detailed to sit on nay court-martial until regarded by his CO
as competent authority  to perform so important a duty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 234:
40.
Composition of General Court-martial.
(1)
A general court-martial shall be composed, as far as seems to the convening officer
practicable, of officers of different corps or departments, and in no case exclusive of officers
of the corps or department to which the accused belongs.
(2)
The members of a court-martial for the trial of an officer shall be of a rank not lower
that that of the officer unless, in the opinion of the convening officer, officers of such rank
are not (having due regard to the exigencies of the public service, available.  Such opinion
shall be recorded in the convening order.
(3)
In no case shall an officer below the rank of captain be a member of a court-martial
for the trial of a field officer.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 235:
1.
There is no similar restriction as to the composition of district courts martial, which
may, therefore, when necessary, be composed wholly of officers, of the corps or department
to which the accused belongs; nut where possible they should not be so composed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 236:
2.
The expression of the convening officers opinion justifying a departure from general
rule should be inserted in the convening order.
Procedure at Trial – Constitution of Court

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 237:
41.
Inquiry by court as to legal constitution.
(1)
On the court-assembling, the order convening the court shall be laid before it
together with the charge sheet and the summary of evidence or a true copy thereof, and
also the ranks, names, and corps of the officers appointed to serve on the court;  and the
court shall satisfy itself that it is legally constituted; that is to say -
(a)
that, so far as the court can ascertain, the court has been convened in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and these rules.
(b)
that the court consists of a number of officers, not less that the minimum
required by law and, save as mentioned in rule 38, not less that the number
detailed;
(c)
that each of the officers so assembled is eligible and not disqualified for
serving on that court-martial; and
(d)
that in the case of general court-martial, the officers are of the required
rank.
(2)
The court shall, further, if it is a general or district court-martial to which a judge-
advocate has been appointed, ascertain that the judge-advocate is duly appointed and is not
disqualified for sitting on that court-martial.
(3)
The court, if not satisfied with regard to the compliance with the aforesaid
provisions shall report its opinion to the convening authority, and may adjourn for that
purpose.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 238:
1.
The inquires necessitated by this and the following rule should be conducted in
closed court.  The court is not “open” at this stage, and the accused has not yet been
brought before it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 239:
2.
The convening order, charge-sheet and the summary or abstract of evidence are to
be placed before the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 240:
3.
Where members are detailed by rank and corps and not by name, then only officers
of the actual rank and corps stated in the convening order can serve as members.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 241:
4.
It is essential that the court should ascertain, as far as it lies in its power, that it has
jurisdiction.  For form of convening order see page 397.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 242:
5.
In the case of a GCM of DCM, the convening order must be signed by the convening
officer or “for” him by a staff officer or by a staff officer as such. The absence of a properly
signed convening order is a fatal flaw although an order for trial is endorsed on the charge-
sheet.  Apart  from the specific requirements of this rule, the court must be satisfied that it is
constituted strictly in accordance with the convening order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 243:
6.
The court, in considering whether it is convened in accordance with the AA and AR,
can only look at the convening order.  The convening officer is responsible that he holds the
necessary court-martial warrant empowering him to convene the court and the court is not
required to satisfy itself in this respect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 244:
7.
For legal minimum and for rank of members of the court, see AA.ss. 113 and 114
and AR 40.  (Also see Regs Army para 459).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 245:
8.
For eligibility and disqualification, see AA.ss 113 and 114 and AR 39.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 246:
9.
When a court of inquiry has been held respecting a matter upon which a charge
against the accused is founded, the presiding officer should insert and sign the certificate
shown in the note on page 399.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 247:
10.
For the appointment of JA, see AA.s 129 and AR 103.  For disqualification of JA, see
AR 102.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 248:
42.
Inquiry by court as to amenability of accused and validity of charge.
(1)
If the court is satisfied that the requirement of rule 41 have been complied with, it
shall further satisfy itself in respect of each charge about to be brought before it-
(a)
that it appears to be laid against a person subject to the Act, and subject to
the jurisdiction of the court, and
(b)
that each charge discloses an offence under the Act and is framed in
accordance with these rules, and is so explicit as to enable the accused readily to
understand what he has to answer.
(2)
The court, if not satisfied on the above matters, shall report its opinion to the
convening authority and may adjourn for that purpose.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 249:
1.
The enquiry by the court under this and the preceding rule should be in closed court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 250:
2.
For amenability to military law, i.e. to the AA, see AA.s. 2 and notes thereto.

Chunk 251:
2.
As to validity of charge, see ARs 28 to 32.
Procedure at Trial – Challenge and Swearing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 252:
43.
Appearance of prosecutor and accused.   When the court has satisfied itself that the
provisions of rules 41 and 42 have been complied with, it shall cause the accused to be brought
before the court and the prosecutor, who must be a person subject to the Act, shall take his due
place in the court.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 253:
1.
The duty of appointing the prosecutor devolves on the convening officer who
ordinarily selects the adjutant of the accused persons unit; but the convening officer should
not appoint himself to be the prosecutor.  The prosecutor cannot confirm the finding and
sentence of a court-martial.  Se AR 74.  In trials by GCM and in complicated cases a
prosecutor should be specially selected for his experience and knowledge of military law,
and should be, as far as possible, relieved from ordinary military duty, so that he may be
enabled fully to master the case.  In ordinary cases one of the officers mentioned in AR 39
(2) may suitably be detailed to act as prosecutor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 254:
2.
As to duties of the prosecutor, see ARs 56 and 59 and 77 and memoranda at page

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 255:
437.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 256:
3.
As to counsel, see ARs 96 to 101.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 257:
44.
Proceedings for challenges of members of court.   The order convening the court and the
names of the presiding officer and the members of the court shall then be read over to the accused
and he shall be asked, as required by section 130, whether he has any objection to being tried by any
officer sitting on the court.  Any such objection shall be disposed of in accordance with the
provisions of the aforesaid section :
Provided that –
(a)
the accused shall state the names of all the officers constituting the court in respect
of whom he has objection, before any objection is disposed of,
(b)
the accused may call any person to give evidence in support of his objection and
such person may be questioned by the accused and by the court.
(c)
if more than one officer is objected to, the objection to each officer shall be
disposed of separately, and the objection in respect of the officers of the lowest in rank shall
be disposed of first; and on an objection to an officer, the remaining officers of the court
shall, in the absence of the challenged officer, vote  on the disposal of such objection,
notwithstanding that objections have also been made to any of those officers.
(d)
when an objection in respect of an officer is allowed, that officer shall forthwith
retire, and take no further part in the proceedings.
(e)
when an officer so retires or is not available to serve owning to any cause, which the
court may deem to be sufficient, and there are any officers in waiting detailed as such, the
presiding officer shall appoint one of such officers to fill the vacancy.  If there is no officer in
waiting  available, the court shall proceed as required by rule 38.
(f)
the eligibility, absence of disqualification, and freedom from objection of an officer
filling a vacancy shall be ascertained by the court, as in the case of other officers appointed
to serve on the court.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 258:
1.
See AA.s. 130 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 259:
2.
Each member should answer to his name as it is called, so that the accused can
identify each member who is to try him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 260:
3.
The accused must make each objection separately: he cannot object to the court
collectively, except upon a plea to the jurisdiction, under AR 51.  If the accused persists in
objection to the court collectively, the court should treat the objection as made to all the
members individually, and the procedure provided by this rule should be strictly followed.
In practice an objection to a member may be equivalent to a plea to the jurisdiction, as for
example when on the trial of a field officer one of the members is objected to because he is
below the rank or Captain.  In such case the objection should be dealt with under this rule,
although it might more properly have been raised under AR 51.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 261:
4.
The accused has no right to object to the prosecutor or JA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 262:
5.
An officer objected to on the ground of personal enmity, prejudice, or malice or for
having formed and expressed an opinion  on the case, should, unless the objection is
obviously groundless, request and be permitted to retire. An officer successfully objected to
on the ground of personal interest is disqualified from serving as a member.  See AR 39
(2)(e).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 263:
6.
The court may be closed to consider each objection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 264:
7.
The witnesses called by the accused in support of his plea cannot be examined on
oath or affirmation since the court is not yet sworn or affirmed, but provision of AR 141  will
substantially apply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 265:
8.
The officer objected to must not be present in the closed court when the objection
in his respect is being considered by the court, but all the other members present, i.e. who
have not retired upon objection to them being allowed, must vote on the disposal of the
objection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 266:
9.
Clause (e) prescribes the manner of filling vacancy created either by a successful
objection or through non-attendance of an officer detailed.  Where any waiting members
are detailed, it is the duty of the presiding officer to appoint one of those members to fill of
corresponding rank to the retiring or absent officer.  If  the presiding officer is himself
successfully objected to the senior remaining member will take his place (AA.s. 128) and will
then proceed to fill the vacancy in the court in the manner indicated above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 267:
10.
If there is no officer in waiting available and the court is reduced in number below
the legal minimum , it must adjourn for the purpose of appointment of fresh members; and
though not so reduced, it should ordinarily adjourn unless it is of opinion that, in the
interests of justice and for the good of the service, it is not expedient to do so.  (AR 38)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 268:
11.
It is desirable to ascertain before the accused brought before the court whether a
waiting member is eligible and qualified to serve if called upon.  An objection to a waiting
member called upon to serve will be dealt with immediately, if he is junior to any other
officers who have been objected to; if he is not, the objection to junior officers will first be
disposed of and he will have to vote on such objections.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 269:
12.
In a doubtful case an objection should always be allowed.  It is very important that
the court should not only be impartial, but be believed by the accused and his comrades to
be so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 270:
45.
Swerving or affirming of members.   As soon as the court is constituted with the proper
number of officers who are not objected to, or objections in respect of who have been over-ruled,
an oath or affirmation shall be administrated to every member in one of the following forms or in
such other form to the same purport as the court ascertains to be according to his religion or
otherwise binding on his conscience.
Form of oath
“I ………………………. Swear by Almighty God that I will well and truly try the accused (or
accused persons) before the Court according to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice
according to the Army Act without partiality, favour or affection and if any doubt shall arise, then,
according to my conscience, the best of my understanding and the custom of war in the like cases;
and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any time, whatsoever, disclose or discover
the vote or opinion of any particular member of this court-martial, unless required to give evidence
thereof by a court of justice or a court-martial in due course of law”.
Form of Affirmation
“I ………………………… do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will well and
truly try the accused (or accused persons) before the Court according to the evidence, and that I will
duly administer justice according to the Army Act without partiality, favour or affection; and if any
doubt shall arise, then, according to my conscience, the best of my understanding and the custom of
war in the like case; and I do further solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will not,
on any account at any time, whatsoever, disclose or discover the vote or opinion of any particular
member of this court-martial, unless required to give evidence thereof by a court of justice or a
court-martial in due course of law”.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 271:
1.
Christians and Sikhs are generally sworn, the former of the New Testament or some
book containing it, and the latter on the Granth.  Hindus and Muslims are generally affirmed.
Jews are sworn on the Old Testament.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 272:
2.
As to the person to administer the oath or affirmation, see AR 47.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 273:
3.
As to swearing the court to try several persons, see AR 89.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 274:
4.
A person taking the oath will hold the book (New Testament, Old Testament or
Granth) in his uplifted hand and will say or repeat the oath after the person administering it.
The oath must be administered and taken with solemnity.  It is not necessary to kiss the
book. Members may be sworn separately or collectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 275:
5.
If a person desires to be sworn in the Scottish form, no question as to his religious
belief is to be asked nor is he required to hold or kiss the Bible while being sworn. He will be
sworn standing and holding up his right hand, and the oath will commence in these terms “I
swear by Almighty God as I shall answer to God at the Great Day of Judgment ……………………

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 276:
6.
Affirmations are repeated by the person making affirmation after the person
administering it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 277:
7.
In addition to providing a prescribed form of oath or affirmation, the rule permits an
oath or affirmation to be administrated to the person to be sworn or affirmed in such form
to the same purport as the court ascertains to be according to his religion or otherwise,
binding on his conscience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 278:
8.
The oath or affirmation taken by the members implies that, as a general rule, the
opinions of the individual members ought not to be stated, and consequently the court
ought not to disclose whether the decision was unanimous or by a majority.  The decision is
the decision of the court as a whole, and the fact of its being unanimous or not is usually
immaterial. The qualification at the end of the oath or affirmation “unless required to give
evidence thereof, etc,” only applies to such cases where members of the court are charged
individually with partiality or bribery, and thus in a court of justice or a court-martial it
would, or might, be necessary to make disclosures regarding individual votes  to the court
trying the members so charged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 279:
46.
Swearing or affirming of judge-advocate and other officers.
After the members of the
court are all sworn or have made affirmation, an oath or affirmation shall be administered to the
following persons or such of them as are present at the court-martial, in such of the following forms
as shall be appropriate, or in such other form to the same purport as the court ascertains to be
according to the religion or otherwise binding on the conscience of the person to be sworn or
affirmed:-
(A) JUDGE ADVOCATE
Form of Oath
“I ……………………………. Swear by Almighty God that I will to the best of my ability carry out
the duties of Judge Advocate in accordance with the Army Act, and the rules made thereunder and
without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any
time whatsoever, disclose or discover the vote or opinion on any matter of any particular members
of this court-martial, unless required to give evidence thereof by a court of justice or, a court-martial
in the due course of law”.
Form of Affirmation
“I  ………………………… do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will to the best
of my ability carry out the duties of Judge Advocate in accordance with the Army Act and the rules
made thereunder and without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further solemnly, sincerely and
truly declare and affirm that I will not on any account at any time, whatsoever, disclose or discover
the cote or opinion on any matter of any particular member of this court-martial, unless required to
give evidence thereof by a court of justice or a court-martial in due course of law”.
(B) OFFICER ATTENDING FOR THE PURPOESE OF INSTRUCTION
Form of oath
“I …………………………… swear by Almighty God that I will not on any account, at any time
whatsoever, disclose or discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of this court-martial
unless required to give evidence thereof by a court of justice or a court-martial, in due course of
law”.
Form of Affirmation
“I ……………………………. do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will not on
any account, any  time whatsoever, disclose or discover the vote or opinion of any particular
member of this court-martial; unless required to give evidence thereof by a court of justice or a
court-martial, in due course of law”.
(C) SHORT HAND WRITER
Form of oath
“I …………………………….. SWEAR BY Almighty God that I will truly take down to the best of my
power the evidence to be given before this court-martial and such other matters as I may be

the same”.
Form of Affirmation
“I, ……………………………… do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will truly

other matters as I may be required, and will, when required deliver to the court a true transcript of
the same”.
(D) INTERPRETER
Form of oath
“I ………………………………. Swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully interpret and translate,
as I shall be required to do, touching the matter before this court-martial”.
Form of Affirmation
“I ………………………………. do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will
faithfully interpret and translate, as I shall be required to do, touching the matter before this court-
martial”.

Notes to AR 45 apply, mutatis mutandis, to this rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 281:
2.
The form of oath and affirmation for a witness are set out in AR 140.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 282:
3.
The accused has a right of objection to the shorthand writer or interpreter, who may
be sworn/affirmed at any time during the trial (AR 90); he has not right of objection to the JA
or to the officers under instruction.

Chunk 283:
47.
Persons to administer oaths and affirmations.  All oaths and affirmations shall be
administered by the Judge Advocate (if any), a member of the court, or some other person
empowered by the Court to administer such oath or affirmation.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 284:
1.
Oaths and affirmations may be administered by any of the persons mentioned in this
rule. Their being of the same religion as the person affirmed or sworn is immaterial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 285:
2.
It will be convenient for the JA to administer the oath or affirmation to the presiding
officer and members, or if there is no JA, for the presiding officer to first administer the oath
and affirmation to the members and then be himself sworn or affirmed by one of them.  The
oath or affirmation to the JA may be administered by the presiding officer.
Prosecution, Defence and Summing-up

Chunk 286:
48.
Arraignment of accused.
(1)
After the members of the court and other persons are sworn or affirmed as
abovementioned, the accused shall be arraigned on the charges against him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 287:
2.
The charges upon which the accused is arraigned shall be read and, if necessary,
translated to him, and he shall be required to plead separately to each charge.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 288:
1.
The accused should be arraigned by the presiding officer or JA (if any).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 289:
2.
“Arraignment” consists of (a) calling upon the accused by his number (if any), Rank,
Name and Description as given in the charge-sheet and asking him “Is that your number,
rank, name and unit (or description)”; (b) reading the charge to him; and (c) asking him
whether he is guilty or not guilty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 290:
3.
Where two or more persons are jointly charged and tried for the same offence, each
is separately arraigned.  Where there are more charge-sheets that one against an accused,
he must be arraigned and until after the finding tried upon the first charge-sheet, before
arraignment upon the second or subsequent charge-sheet; see AR 79.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 291:
4.
The charge-sheet, containing the charges as settled by the convening officer, will be
in the possession of the presiding officer (AR 34(4)), who will lay the charge-sheet before the
court immediately before arraignment, and the charge-sheet will then be annexed to the
proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 292:
5.
The plea of the accused must be taken on all the charges in a charge-sheet.  This
applies to alternative charges if the accused has been arraigned upon them, but see AR 52
(3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 293:
49.
Objection by accused to charge.  The accused, when required to plead to any charge, may
object to the charge on the ground that it does not disclose an offence under the Act, or is not in
accordance with these rules.  The court after hearing any submission which may be made by the
prosecutor or by or on behalf of the accused, shall consider the objection in closed court and shall
either disallow it and proceed with the trial, or allow it and adjourn to report to the convening
authority or, if it is in doubt, it may adjourn to consult the convening authority.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 294:
1.
A charge laid under AA.s. 54 (b) for losing by neglect the property of a comrade
would not disclose an offence under that section of the Act.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 295:
2.
As to framing of charges see ARs 28 to 32.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 296:
3.
As to joint charges see AR 35 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 297:
4.
For procedure where  it appears that the accused is, by reason of insanity, unfit to
stand his trial, see AR 145.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 298:
50.
Amendment of charge.
(1)
At any time during the trial, if it appears to the court that there is any mistake in the
name or description of the accused in the charge-sheet, the court may amend the charge-
sheet so as to correct that mistake.
(2)
If, on the trial of any charge, it appears to the court at any time before it has begun
to examine the witnesses, that in the interest of justice any addition to, omission form, or
alteration in the charge is required, it may report its opinion to the convening authority, and
may, adjourn and the convening authority may either direct the new trial to be commenced,
or amend the charge, and order the trial to proceed with such amended charge after due
notice to the accused.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 299:
1.
a mistake in name or description will only be amended, if it is clear to the court that
the accused is the person intended to be charged in the charge-sheet, and that, he is not
prejudiced in his defence by the mistake having been made.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 300:
2.
The court may act under sub-rule (1) whether the objection to the charge is taken by
the accused or by the JA, or by a member of the court, and either before or after the
arraignment of the accused; see AR 42 and 49.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 301:
3.
The witnesses referred to in sub-rule (2) are the ones on the substance of the
charge and not those who are called as to objections to the members, or with respect to a
special plea to the jurisdiction, under AR 51.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 302:
4.
If the addition, omission, or alteration can be met by means of a special finding
under AR 62 (4) (as, for instance, by omitting from the finding some of the articles alleged to
have been stolen or lost by neglect, or by correcting a mistake in an immaterial date), it will
not usually be necessary to have the charge amended; but  if the date is material or if any
addition requires to be made to the particulars of the charge, it will be safer for the court to
adjourn and apply for the amendment.  If the charge appears not to disclose an offence
under the AA, the court must adjourn; see AR 49.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 303:
51.
Special plea to the jurisdiction.
(1)
The accused, before pleading to a charge, may offer a special plea to the general
jurisdiction of the court, and if he does so, and the court consider that anything stated in
such plea shows that the court has no jurisdiction it shall receive any evidence offered in
support, together with any evidence officered by the prosecutor in disproof or qualification
thereof, and any address by or on behalf of the accused and reply by the prosecutor in
reference thereto.
(2)
If the court overrules the special plea, it shall proceed with the trial.
(3)
If the court allows the special plea, it shall record its decision and the reasons for it,
and report it to the convening authority and adjourn; such decision shall not require any
confirmation, and the convening authority shall either forthwith convene another court for
the trial of the accused, or order the accused to be released.
(4)
If the court is in doubt as to the validity of the plea, it may refer the matter to the
convening authority, and may adjourn for that purpose or may record a special decision with
respect to such plea, and proceed with the trial.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 304:
1.
A plea to the general jurisdiction, that is, to the right of the court generally to try the
accused on any charge at all, is here kept distinct from any plea which relates only to the
particular charge on which the accused is brought before the court.  Under the former he
may plead, for example, that the court is improperly constituted in respect of the members,
or that he is not amenable to the court, either as not being subject to AA or not subject to
that description of the court; as for instance in the case of a JCO being brought for trial
before a DCM.

Chunk 305:
2.
A plea relating to the particular charge, and raising the defence of previous
conviction or acquittal by a court-martial or criminal court, summary punishment by the CO,
pardon of the offence or its condonation by the deliberate act of some superior authority or
of the lapse of more than three years since the date of the offence (AA.s. 122) will be raised
byway of plea in bar of trial, under AR 53.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 306:
3.
Evidence must be taken on oath or affirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 307:
4.
The confirmation of the finding, after a plea to the jurisdiction has been overruled,
will have the effect of confirming the decision of the court in overruling the plea.  If,
however, the confirming officer is of opinion that the plea is valid and should have been
allowed, he must refuse to confirm the finding of the court and another court may legally be
convened.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 308:
5.
If the court allows the plea, the decision of the court cannot be over-ruled, but
another court may legally be convened.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 309:
6.
If a special plea to the jurisdiction is raised, e.g., on the ground that the accused is
not subject to AA, and the court is in doubt as to the validity of the plea, it may record a
special decision to that effect, and state that it has nevertheless decided to proceed with the
trial.  This procedure, in effect, transfers the decision as to the validity of the plea to the
confirming officer, who should act as if the plea has been over-ruled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 310:
52.
General plea of “guilty” or “not guilty”.
(1)
If no special plea to the general jurisdiction of the court is offered, or if such plea
being offered, is over-ruled, or is dealt with by a special decision under sub-rule (4) of rule

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 311:
51, the accused person’s plea “Guilty” or “Not guilty” (or if he refuses to plead, or does not
plead intelligibly either one or the other a plea of “Not guilty”) shall be recorded on each
charge.
(2)
If an accused person pleads,\ “Guilty”, the plea shall be recorded as the finding of
the court; but before it is recorded, the presiding officer or judge advocate, on behalf of the
court, shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature of the charge to which he has
pleaded guilty and shall inform him of the general effect of that plea, and in particular of the
meaning of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty, and of the difference in procedure
which will be made by the plea of guilty, and shall advise him to withdraw that plea if it
appears from the summary of evidence that the accused ought to plead “Not guilty”.
(2.A)
Where an accused pleads Guilty, such plea and the factum of compliance of sub-rule
(2) of this rule, shall be recorded by the court in the following manner:-
Before recording the plea of Guilty of the accused, the court explained to
the accused the meaning of the charge(s) to which he had pleaded Guilty and
ascertained that the accused had understood the nature of the charge(s) to which
he had pleaded Guilty.  The court also informed the accused the general effect of
the plea and the difference in procedure, which will be followed consequent to the
said plea.  The court having satisfied itself that the accused understands the
charge(s) and the effect of his plea of Guilty, accepts and records the same. The
provisions of rule 52 (2) are thus complied with.
(3)
Where an accused person pleads “Guilty”, to the first of two or more charges laid in
the alternative, the prosecutor may, after sub-rule (2) has been complied with by the court
and before the accused is arraigned on the alternative charge or charges, withdraw such
alternative charge or charges without requiring the accused to plead thereto and a record to
that effect shall be made upon the proceedings of the court.
(4)
A plea of “Guilty” shall not be accepted in cases where the accused is liable, if
convicted to be sentenced to death, and where such plea is offered, a plea of “Not
Guilty” shall be recorded and the trial shall proceed accordingly.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 312:
1.
If the accused pleads in some language not understood by the court, or
inarticulately, he will not have pleaded intelligibly, and the plea of “Not guilty” will be
entered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 313:
2.
Sub-rule (2) is qualified by sub-rule (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 314:
3.
The object of sub-rule (2) is to prevent the accused from pleading guilty under a
misapprehension; e.g., a man charged with willfully injuring government property may,
under a misapprehension, plead guilty because the property has been actually injured,
though not willfully; or a man charged with receiving property, knowing it to have been
stolen may, under a misapprehension, plead “guilty” because the property was in fact
stolen, though when he received it, he did not know it to have been stolen.  So again, on a
charge for desertion, the plea “Guilty, but I intended to return” amounts to a plea of “Not
Guilty”, as the intention not to return is generally an essential element in the offence of
desertion. In such cases the presiding officer must explain to the accused that he must plead
“Not guilty”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 315:
4.
A Plea of “Guilty” is to be taken to the extent to which it is pleaded.  Thus a sepoy
arraigned upon a charge of losing by neglect a number of articles, who pleads guilty in
respect of some of those articles only, must be taken to have offered a “qualified” plea of
guilty. The court may accept such a qualified plea of guilty, if it is satisfied of the justice of
such course and if the concurrence of the convening officer is signified by the prosecutor,
and come to a special finding under AR 62 (4) and (5), subject to the exceptions in relation to
the articles to which he has not pleaded guilty, see AR 62 (9).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 316:
5.
If the accused pleads guilty, a statement that the requirements of AR 52 (2) have
been complied with must be recorded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 317:
6.
It must be recollected that there is nothing untrue in a person pleading not guilty
even though he committed the offence, as the plea merely amounts to claim, which he is
entitled to make, that the charge against him shall be formally proved.  Indeed; where the
accused, while admitting the offence, wishes to show that it was committed under
circumstances of great provocation and does not deserve severe punishment, he must plead
not guilty if he wishes to prove the existence of such provocation out of the mouths of
witnesses for the prosecution, who would not be called to given evidence if he pleaded
guilty; (see AR 54(7) as to the power of the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 318:
7.
As to procedure where it appears at a later stage of the proceeding that the plea of
guilty was offered under a misapprehension, see AR 54(5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 319:
8.
If the prosecutor adopts the procedure provided by sub-rule (3), the accused will not
be entitled to a verdict on the alternative charges, as he will not have been arraigned upon
them.  The convening officer must take care that the most serious of two or more
alternative charges are placed first in the charge-sheet.  As to the procedure to be followed
in other case where there are alternative charges, see AR 54(1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 320:
9.
Sub-rule (4) is intended to ensure that a person charged with an offence for which
death penalty can be awarded shall not be convicted without a full trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 321:
53.
Plea in bar.
(1)
The accused, at the time of his general plea of “Guilty” or “Not Guilty” to a charge
for an offence, may offer a plea in bar of trial on the ground that :-
(a)
he has been previously convicted or acquitted of the offence by a
competent criminal court or by a court-martial, or has been dealt with summarily
under section 80, 83, 84 and 85, as the case may be, for the offence, or that a charge
in respect of the offence has been dismissed as provided in sub-rule (2) of rule 22; or
(b)
the offence has been pardoned or condoned by competent military
authority; or
(c)
the period of limitation for trial as laid down in section 122 has expired.
(2)
If he offers such plea in bar, the court shall record it as well as his general plea, and if
it considers that any fact or facts stated by him are sufficient to support the plea in bar, it
shall receive any evidence offered, and hear any address made by or on behalf of the
accused and the prosecutor in reference to the plea.
(3)
If the court finds that the plea in bar is proved, it shall record its finding, and notify it
to the confirming authority, and shall either adjourn, or if there is any other charge against
the accused, whether in the same or in a different charge-sheet, which is not affected by the
plea in bar, may proceed to the trial of the accused on that charge.
(4)
If the finding that the plea in bar is proved is not confirmed, the court may be re-
assembled by the confirming authority, and proceed as if the plea had been found not
proved.
(5)
If the court finds that the plea in bar is not proved, it shall proceed with the trial, and
the said findings shall be subject to confirmation like any other finding of the court.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 322:
1.
AA provides that a man shall not be liable to trial for an offence of which he has
been convicted or acquitted by a court-martial or by a criminal court, or for which he has
been dealt with summarily (AA.s. 121), or which was committed more than three years
before the date of his trial, unless the offence was mutiny, desertion or fraudulent
enrolment.  Mutiny or desertion on active service, may be tried at any time.  Desertion at
other times or fraudulent enrolment is not be tried, if the offender, not being an officer, has
served for 3 years subsequently in an exemplary manner in any portion of regular Army
(AA.s. 122).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 323:
2.
The accused may also offer a plea in bar on the ground that a charge in respect of
the offence has been dismissed as provided in AR 22(2), i.e., that he has been acquitted or
the offence has been condoned, by his CO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 324:
3.
It has long been recognised as a custom of the service that a military offence can be
condoned.  For the purpose of barring a trial condonation means such conduct of the part of
a competent authority having power to determine that the charge should not be proceeded
with – as is inconsistent with subsequently trying the offender, and as would make it
inequitable to do so; it must be a deliberate and intentional act, done with full knowledge of
all material facts.  If, with full knowledge of the facts, competent authority removes an
officer, or allows him to resign, he should not afterwards be tried by court-martial for his
offence.  The fact that after trial, but before confirmation, the accused has been employed in
active operation does not effect the legal validity of the sentence, but affords ground for
pardon.
(4)
The evidence on the plea is to be taken on oath or affirmation.
(5)
If the finding on the plea, where the court allows it is confirmed, it amounts to an
acquittal and is final.  It must be noted that the finding of the court upon a plea in bar of trial
whether in favour of or against the plea, is subject to confirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 325:
54.
Procedure after plea of “Guilty”.
(1)
Upon the record of the plea of “Guilty”, if there are other charges in the same
charge-sheet to which the plea is “Not Guilty”, the trial shall first proceed with respect to the
latter charges, and after the finding on those charges, shall proceed with the charges on
which a plea of “Guilty” has been entered, but if they are alternative charges, the court may
either proceed with respect to all the charges as if the accused had not pleaded “Guilty” to
any charge or may subject to sub-rule (2), instead of trying him, record a finding of “Guilty”
upon any one of the alternative charges to which he has pleaded “Guilty” and a finding of
“Not Guilty” upon all the other alternative charges.
(2)
Where alternative charges are preferred and the accused pleads “Not Guilty” to the
charge which alleges the more serious offence and “Guilty” to the other, the court shall try
him as if he had pleaded “Not Guilty” to all the charges.
(3)
After the record of the plea of “Guilty” on a charge (if the trial does not proceed on
any other charges) the court shall receive any statement which the accused desires to make
in reference to the charge, and shall read the summary of evidence and annex it to the
proceedings, or if there is no such summary shall take and record sufficient evidence to
enable it to determine the sentence and the confirming officer to know all the circumstances
connected with the offence.  This evidence shall be taken in the manner provided in these
rules in the case of plea of “Not Guilty”.
(4)
After evidence has been so taken, or the summary of evidence has been read, as the
case may be, the accused may make a statement in mitigation of punishment, and may call
witnesses as to his defence.
(5)
If from the statement of the accused or from the summary of evidence, or
otherwise, it appears to the court that the accused did not understand the effect of his plea
of “Guilty”, the court shall alter the record and enter a plea of “Not Guilty”, and proceed
with the trial accordingly.
(6)
If a plea of “Guilty” is recorded, and the trial proceeds with respect to other charges
in the same charge-sheet, the proceedings under sub-rule (3) and (4) shall take place when
the findings on the other charges in the same charge-sheet are recorded.
(7)
When the accused states anything in mitigation of punishment which in the opinion
of the court requires to be provided, and would, if proved, affect the amount of punishment,
the court may permit the accused to call witnesses to prove the same.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 326:
1.
An accused person cannot be found guilty upon more than one of two or more
charges laid in the alternative, even if conviction upon one charge necessarily cannotes guilt
upon the alternative charges or charges,  See AR 62(7).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 327:
2.
Where two alternative charges are preferred and the accused pleads “Not Guilty” to
the charge which alleges the more serious offence and “Guilty” to the other, the court
should try him as provided by sub-rule (2), as if he has pleaded “Not Guilty” to both charges.
Having regard to AR 52 (3), the most serious of two or more alternative charges should
always be placed first in a charge-sheet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 328:
3.
For procedure when statement made by the accused with reference to the charge is
inconsistent with his plea; see notes 5 and 6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 329:
4.
The accused will always be asked, in case of a plea of “Guilty”, whether he desires to
all witness to character.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 330:
5.
The statement referred to in sub-rule (5) includes a statement made by the accused
under sub-rule (3)  in reference to the charge, as well as a statement made in mitigation
under sub-rule (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 331:
6.
The following examples are given of cases in which a plea of “Guilty” should be
altered to a plea of “Not Guilty” under sub-rule (5):-
(a)
Sepoy A, charged with desertion (not being desertion to avoid a particular
service), states “I always meant to come back”
(b)
Sepoy B, charged with using criminal force to his superior officer, states, “I
only did it to defend myself after he had struck me”.
(c)
Sepoy C is charged with sleeping upon his post when a sentry.  He makes no
statement with reference to the charge.  On the reading of the summary of
evidence, it is found that all the witnesses state that Sepoy C was beyond the
confines of his post when found asleep.
(d)
Naik D is charged with disobeying a lawful command given by Naik E, his
superior officer, and makes no statement with reference to the charge.  He calls a
witness as to character, who states incidentally that Naik E is junior to Naik D.  In this
case the action of the court in altering the plea of the accused would be founded
upon the words “or otherwise” in sub-rule (5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 332:
7.
The test to be applied in all such cases is not whether the court believes the
statement, but whether, if the statement was true, it would be a valid defence to the
charge.  In doubtful cases, the plea of “Guilty” should be altered to a plea of “Not guilty”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 333:
8.
If the court fails to act under the provisions of sub-rule (5), the confirming officer
should refuse confirmation and can order a new trial.  If he confirms, the finding will be set
aside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 334:
9.
Where the accused alleges provocation for the offence, it may be desirable to record
a plea of “Not guilty”; see note 6 to AR 52.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 335:
10.
In any case where the court is empowered to come to a special finding under the
provisions of AA.s. 139 or AR 62 (4) and (5), the court may accept a qualified plea of guilty in
respect of an offence; see AR 62 (9).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 336:
11.
Although under sub-rule (7) the permission of the court is required to enable the
accused to call witnesses in extenuation of the offence, and consequent mitigation of
punishment, such permission should always be given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 337:
12.
For procedure in case of joint trails where one accused pleads guilty and the other
not guilty, see note 4 to AR 35.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 338:
55.
Withdrawal of plea of “Not Guilty” subject to compliance with sub-rules (2) and (4) of Rule

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 339:
52.   The accused may, if he thinks fit, at any time during the trial, withdraw his plea of “Not Guilty”,
and plead “Guilty” and in such case the court will at once, subject to a compliance with sub-rules (2)
and (4) of rule 52, record a plea and finding of “Guilty” and shall, so far as is necessary, proceed in
manner directed by rule 54.
NOTE
If the accused proposes to withdraw his plea of not guilty, the court must inform
him of the general effect of his withdrawal, and of the difference in the procedure, in the
same manner as if he pleaded guilty under AR 52.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 340:
56.
Plea of “Not Guilty”, application for adjournment, and case for the prosecution.  After the
plea of “Not Guilty” to any charge is recorded, the trial shall proceed as follows, that is to say:-
(1)
the court shall ask the accused whether he wishes to apply for an
adjournment on the ground that any of the rules relating to procedure before trial
have not been complied with, and that he has been prejudiced thereby or on the
ground that he has not had sufficient opportunity for preparing his defence, and
shall record his answer;
(2)
if the accused shall make any such  application, the court shall hear any
statement of evidence which he may desire to adduce in support thereof, and any
statement of the prosecutor or evidence in answer thereto; and if it shall appear to
the court that the accused has been prejudiced by an non-compliance with any of
such rules relating to procedure or that he has not had sufficient opportunity of
preparing  his defene , it may grant such adjournment as may appear to it in the
circumstances to be proper;
(3)
the prosecutor may, if he desires, and shall, if so required by the court make
an opening address, and shall state therein the substance of the charge against the
accused and the nature and general effect of the evidence which  he proposes to
adduce in the support of it with out entering into any unnecessary detail;
(4)
the evidence for the prosecution shall the be taken;
(5)
If it should be necessary for the prosecutor to give evidence to give evidence
for the prosecution on the facts of the case, he shall give it after the delivery of his
address (if any), and must be sworn or affirmed, as the case may be, and give his
evidence in detail; and
(6)
he may be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused and afterwards
may make any statement which might be made by a witness or re-examination.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 341:
1.
As to the rights of the accused to prepare his defence, see AR 33 and notes
thereto.  As to warning of accused for trial see AR 34 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 342:
2.
For adjournment see AR 82.  The court must adjourn if it appears to it that
the accused is likely to be prejudiced by non-compliance with any of the rules
relating to procedure before trial or that he did not have sufficient time to prepare
his defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 343:
3.
As to the duties of the prosecutor see AR 77, and notes, and memoranda on
page 437.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 344:
4.
In case of complexity the prosecutor should always make an opening
address, so that the members of the court may be enabled to understand the
general nature of the allegations.  He  must be careful to refrain form making any
assertions which he does not propose to substantiate by evidence.  The address of
the prosecutor may be in writing in such a case it should be read by him and handed
to the court for attachment to the proceedings.  If  the address is made orally see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 345:
92 (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 346:
5.
For General provisions as to witnesses and evidence, see ARs 134 to 143.
The evidence will be taken by question and answer, or the witness may be asked to
tell his own story, question being subsequently asked to make good any omission
(see AR 92(2).  It is the duty of the prosecutor to conduct the examination of the
witnesses for the prosecution  and to see that all facts essential to constitute the
offence are proved; e.g., on a charge laid under AA.s. 56(a) for making a false
accusation against Havildar A it must be proved:-
(a)
that the accused made the accusation in question against Havildar
A.
(b)
that it was false.
(c)
that the accused made it knowing it to be false.
The prosecutor must be careful, in examining his witnesses, to avoid putting
leading or suggestive question,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 347:
6.
Documentary evidence will be read by the presiding officer or JA; it will then
be marked with a distinguishing letter or figure and attached to the proceedings.  As
a rule, it will be sufficient to attach copies of documents which must, however, be
compared with the originals by the court and certified under the hand or the
presiding officer to be true copies; see note 3 to AR 67.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 348:
7.
For the duties of the presiding officer, see AR 76.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 349:
8.
If the same person gives evidence in more than one case tried by the same
court, he must be sworn (or affirmed) as a witness in each case, even if all such cases
are tried on a single day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 350:
9.
The prosecutor should never give evidence for the prosecution, unless it be
evidence of a merely formal nature, or for the purpose of producing documents
which are in his possession.  In exceptional cases, however (e.g., active service), no
prosecutor may be available except an officer who is a material witness as to the
facts for the prosecution.  In such a case the prosecutor must give his evidence
before any other witness for the prosecution, and must not, after delivering an
address, be allowed to answer generally as to the  truth of the statements contained
in such address.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 351:
10.
When counsel appears on behalf of the prosecutor, sub-rule (5) and (6) of
this rule do not apply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 352:
11.
As to questions by the court see ARs 142 and 143.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 353:
57.
Plea of no case.
(1)
At the close of the case for the prosecution, the accused may offer a plea that the
evidence given on behalf of the prosecution, in respect of any one or more charges, has not
established a prima-facie case against him and that he would not, therefore, be called upon
to make his defence to that charge or charges.
(2)
Where the accused taken such a plea, the prosecutor may address the court in
answer thereto and the accused may reply.
(3)
The court shall consider the plea in closed court and shall not allow the plea unless
satisfied that:-
(a)
the prosecution has not established a prime-facie case on the charge or
charge or charges as laid; and
(b)
it is not open to it on the evidence adduced to make a special finding either
under section 139 or sub-rule (4) of rule 62.
(4)
If the court allows the plea, it shall record a finding of “Not Guilty” on the charge or
charges, to which the plea relates, and shall announce the finding forthwith in open court as
subject to confirmation.
(5)
If the court over rules the plea, it shall proceed with the trial.
(6)
If the court has any doubt as to the validity of the plea, it may refer the matter to
the convening authority, and adjourn for that purpose.
(7)
The court may, of its own motion, after the close of the case for the prosecution,
and after hearing the prosecutor find the accused “Not Guilty” of the charge, and announce
the finding forthwith in open court as subject to confirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 354:
8.
The court shall record brief reasons while arriving at the finding on the plea, in
accordance with sub-rule (1) of rule 62.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 355:
58.
Examination of the accused and defence witnesses.
(1)
(a)
In every trial, for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to explain
any circumstances appearing in evidence against him, the court or the Judge Advocate –
(i)
may at any state, without previously warning the accused, put such
questions to him as considers necessary;
(ii)
shall, after the close of the case for the prosecution and before he is
called on for his defence, question him generally on the case.
(b)
No oath shall be administered to the accused when he is examined under
clause (a).
(c)
The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to
answer questions referred in clause (a) above, or by giving answers to them which
he knows not to be true.
(2)
After the close of the case for the prosecution, the presiding officer or the judge
advocate, if any, shall explain to the accused that he may make an unsworn statement,
orally or in writing, giving his account of the subject of the charge (s) against him or if he
wishes, he may give evidence as a witnesses, on oath or affirmation, in disproof of the
charges (s) against him or any person charged together with him at the same trial :
Provided that:-
(a)
he shall not be called as a witness except on his own request in writing;
(b)
his failure to give evidence shall not be made the subject of any comment by
any of the parties or the court or give rise to any presumption against himself or any
person  charged together with him at the same trial;
(c)
If he gives evidence on oath or affirmation, he shall be examined as first
witness for defence and shall be liable to be cross-examined by the prosecutor and
to be questioned by the court.
(3)
The accused may then call his witnesses including, if he so desires, any witnesses as
to character. If the accused intends to call witnesses as to the facts of the case other than
himself, he may make an opening address before the evidence for defence is given.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 356:
1.
The question as to the calling  of witnesses will be put by the JA, or if there is none,
by the presiding officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 357:
2.
The statement referred to in sub-rule (2) (a) cannot be made on oath or affirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 358:
3.
The presiding officer or the JA may question the accused for the purpose of enabling
him (accused) to explain any circumstances appearing in his statement or in the evidence
against him. Such question may be put even though the accused has made no statement.
The questions and the accused’s answer there should, as far as possible, be recorded
verbatim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 359:
4.
The questions should not be put in the way of cross-examination or for testing his
defends or for supplementing the prosecution case.  The accused does not render himself
liable to punishment for refusing to answers such questions or giving answers to them which
he knows not to be true.  The court may draw such inference from the refusal of the accused
or the answers given by him as it thinks just.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 360:
5.
The accused has the privilege of making statements which are unsupported by
evidence.  Any statement of the facts, though not on oath, upon which the accused relies for
his defence, must be taken into consideration by the court, who may draw its inferences
form from it; see note 4 of AR 61.  If made orally, it should be taken down verbatim, so far as
it states facts which are within the personal knowledge of the accused and upon which he
relies for his defence.  If made in writing it shall be read and attached to the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 361:
6.
If the accused calls witnesses to the facts of the case, the accused or the defending
officer or the defence counsel is required to make his closing address first and the
prosecutor has a right to reply.  In all other cases, the prosecutor’s closing address will
precede that of the defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 362:
7.
The facts that the accused has stated that he does not intend to call any witnesses
to the facts of the case does not prevent him from doing so before the evidence for the
defence is completed if, for example, unexpected witnesses become available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 363:
8.
As to calling and recalling witnesses in reply see AR 143.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 364:
9.
It is the duty of counsel for the defence or defending officer (if any) to conduct the
examination of the witnesses for the defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 365:
10.
As to  counsel and defending officer, see ARs 95 to 101.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 366:
11.
The utmost liberty consistent with the interests of parties not before the court and
with the dignity of the court itself should be allowed to accused in making his defence (see
AR 77(3), and the court should, if necessary adjourn to allow him time for the preparation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 367:
12.
The prosecutor’s address may be in writing, and in such a case it should be read by
the prosecutor and handed to the court for attachment to the proceedings. If the address is
made orally; see AR 92(4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 368:
13.
Counsel for the defence may not state as a fact any matter which has not been
proved in evidence (AR 100) and the same restriction is placed upon a defending officer (AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 369:
95(3)).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 370:
14
In his closing address the prosecutor must confine his remarks to the evidence given
by the witnesses for the prosecution and defence; he must not strain or overstate that view
of the facts which it is his duty to present to the court he must not state any new fact which
has not been given in evidence.  Any deviation in these respects on the part of the
prosecutor, or any want of moderation, may lead to the setting aside of the proceedings; if it
appears that injustice has been done thereby to the accused.  It is the duty of the court, as
far as possible, to prevent the prosecutor from transgressing in any of these respect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 371:
15.
For procedure when two or more persons are tried together, see AR 78.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 372:
59.
Closing Address.  After the examination of the witnesses, the prosecutor may make a closing
address and the accused or his counsel or the defending officer, as the case may be, shall be entitled
to reply:
Provided that where any point of law is raised by the accused, the prosecutor may,
with the permission of the court.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 373:
1.
The notes to the preceding rule should be referred to generally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 374:
2.
Counsel (AR 100) and defending officer (AR 95(3) are not permitted, in an opening
address to state as facts matters which they do not intend to prove in evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 375:
3.
As to order of addresses in joint trials, see AR 78.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 376:
60.
Summing up by the judge-advocate.
(1)
The judge-advocate (if any) shall sum up in open court the evidence and advise the
court upon the law relating to the case.
(2)
After the summing up of the judge-advocate, no other address shall be allowed.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 377:
1.
A summing up by the JA is obligatory under sub-rule (1).  it may be given orally or in
writing;  see AR 144; but in practice it should invariable be in writing.
In his summing up the JA should explain the charges and the law relating to them,
the issues raised by the charges and briefly recapitulate the evidence on such issues.  He
must be careful not to indicate to the court any opinion he may have formed regarding the
facts of the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 378:
2.
For the powers and duties of JA, see 105 and notes thereto.
Finding and sentence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 379:
61.
Consideration of finding.
(1)
The court shall deliberate on its finding in closed court in the presence of the judge-
advocate.
(2).
The opinion of each member of the court as to the finding shall be given by word of
mouth on charge separately.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 380:
1.
For sitting in closed court see AR 80.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 381:
2.
The presiding officer should initiate the deliberations of the court by a statement of
the questions to be considered and the order in which they should be considered.  If, for
example, the charge is laid under AA.s. 41 (2), he will ask the members to discuss the bearing
of the evidence upon the following questions:
(a)
was a command given?  (b)
was it a lawful command : (c)  was it given
by the superior officer of the accused?  (d)  was it disobeyed by the accused?  (e)  did
the accused know that the person giving the order was his superior officer?
Similarly, where the charge laid is under AA.s. 63, the questions to be considered
should be:
(a)
have the facts alleged in the particulars of the charge been proved in
evidence?  if they have,
(b)
do such facts amount to an act (or omission) prejudicial to good order and
military discipline?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 382:
3.
If the court is doubtful whether the actual offence charged is proved or whether the
particulars of the charge have been satisfactorily established in evidence, they must consider
their powers of making a special finding, either under AA.s. 139 or under AR 62 (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 383:
4.
The members of courts-martial must remember that (a) it is a fundamental maxim of
law  that an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he has been proved to be
guilty, and (b) that their finding must be based upon the evidence given before them.  See
AR 45 for form of oath/affirmation for members.  It should be remembered that the accused
cannot give evidence on oath, and therefore any statement made by him must be carefully
considered.  Though not given an oath and subject to the fact of cross-examination, it will
often be of value, particularly if
it is in any respect corroborated by evidence from other sources (see note 4 to AR 58).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 384:
5.
At any time before the finding has been arrived at the court may be reopened to
enable a witness to be called or recalled and examined by it through the presiding officer or
JA : see AR 143(4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 385:
6.
As to form and record of finding, see AR 62.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 386:
7.
The opinion of members must be given orally.  As to taking opinions see AR 87 and
notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 387:
62.
Form, record and announcement of finding.
(1)
The finding on every charge upon which the accused is arraigned shall be recorded
and, except as provided in these rules, shall be recorded as finding of ‘Guilty’ or of ‘Not
Guilty’.  After recording the finding on each charge, the court shall give brief reasons in
support thereof.  The judge advocate or, if there is none, the presiding officer shall record or
cause to be recorded such brief reasons in the proceedings.  The above record shall be
signed and dated by the presiding officer and the judge advocate, if any.
(2)
Where the court is of opinion as regards any charge that the facts proved do not
disclose the offence charged or any offence of which he might under the Act legally be found
guilty of the charge as laid, the court shall acquit the accused of that charge.
(3)
If the court doubts as regards any charge whether the facts proved show the
accused to be guilty or not of the offence charged or of any offence of which he might under
the Act legally be found guilty on the charge as laid, it may, before recording a finding on
that charge, refer to the confirming authority for an opinion, setting out the facts which it
finds to be proved, and may if necessary, adjourn for that purpose.
(4)
Where the court is of the opinion as regards any charge that the facts which it finds
to be proved in evidence differ materially from the facts alleged in the statement of
particulars in the charge, but are nevertheless sufficient to prove the offence stated in the
charge, and that difference is not so material is to have prejudiced the accused in his
defence, it may, instead of a finding of “Not Guilty”, record a special finding.
(5)
The special finding may find the accused guilty on a charge subject to the statement
of exceptions or variations specified therein.
(6)
Where there are alternative charges, and the facts proved appear to the court not to
constitute the offence mentioned in any of those alternative charges, the court shall record
a finding of “Not Guilty” on that charge.
(7)
The court shall not find the accused guilty on more than one of two or more charges
laid down in the alternative, even if conviction upon the charge necessarily connotes guilty
upon the alternative charge or charges.
(8)
If the court thinks that the facts proved constitute one of the offences stated in two
or more of the alternative charges, but doubts which of those offences the facts do at law
constitute, it may, before recording a finding on those charges, refer to the confirming
authority for an opinion, setting out the facts which it finds to be proved and stating that it
doubts whether those facts constitute in the law the offence stated in such one or other of
the charges and may, if necessary, adjourn for that purpose.
(9)
In any case where the court is empowered by section 139 to find the accused guilty
of an offence other than the charge, or guilty of committing an offence in circumstances
involving a less degree of punishment, or where it could, after hearing the evidence, have
made a special finding of guilty subject to exceptions or variations in accordance with sub-
rules (4) and (5) it may, if it is satisfied of the justice of such course, and if the concurrence of
the convening officer is signified by the prosecutor, accept and record a plea of guilty of such
other offences or of the offence as having been committed in circumstances involving such
less degree of punishment or of the offence charged subject to such exceptions or
variations:
Provided that failure to obtain the concurrence of the convening officer as aforesaid
shall not invalidate the proceedings when confirmed notwithstanding such failure.
(10)
The finding on each charge shall be announced forthwith in open court as subject to
confirmation.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 388:
1.
Sub-rule (1) is applicable to all charges including alternative charges, except in those
cases which fall within AR 52(3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 389:
2.
In the case of an acquittal on every charge, the presiding officer must date and sign
the proceedings.  The JA, if any, must also sign; see AR 63.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 390:
3.
Where a person is charged with dishonestly receiving property, knowing it to be
stolen, and the facts show that, although the property was in fact stolen, the accused was
unaware that it was stolen property, the court acquit as provided by sub-rule (2), as the
accused would not have committed the offence charged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 391:
4.
For special findings in respect of the statement of offence, see AA.s 139.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 392:
5.
Before referring to the confirming authority as provided under sub-rule (3), the
court must have arrived at a decision as to the facts which it finds to be proved and the
opinion of the confirming authority will be sought as to whether, upon the facts so found to
be proved, the accused can legally be found guilty.  The court cannot refer to the confirming
authority for any opinion as to the facts, as to which it is the sole judge.  The reasons for the
reference should be recorded.  The opinion of the confirming officer should be read upon re-
assembly of the court and attached to the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 393:
6.
The special finding referred to in sub-rule (4) relates only to the particulars of the
charge, and not to the statement of the offence, as to which see AA.s. 139 and notes.
Before recording a special finding under this sub-rule, the court must be satisfied that the
facts which it finds to be proved, subject to certain exceptions and variations, amount to the
substance of the charge; otherwise they must acquit; e.g.,
(a)
On a charge against a sepoy for losing by neglect a great coat and a waist
belt, the court may properly find the accused “guilty” of the charge except that he
did not lose a “waist belt” , but it cannot legally find him “guilty of the charge except
that he made away with and did not lose the articles in question”.
(b)
An immaterial variation of date may be made by special finding, but in cases
of desertion or absence without leave, the substitution of a date which would have
the effect of lengthening the period of absence alleged in the charge, would not be
permissible.
(c)
On a charge of using criminal force to his superior officer (Havildar A) by
striking him with his fist in the face, the court could properly except the words “in
the face”, but it cannot make a special finding substituting Havildar B for Havildar A.
(d)
On a charge of dishonestly misappropriating Rs. 100, a special finding that
the sum misappropriated was Rs. 50 would be permissible; but a special finding
omitting from the particulars the word “dishonestly” would be tantamount to an
acquittal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 394:
7.
For general procedure in respect of sub-rule (8) see not 5 above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 395:
8.
Sub-rule (9) provides that where the court is empowered to come to a special
finding under the provisions of AA.s. 139 or AR 62 sub-rule (4) and (5), it may accept a
qualified plea of guilty, if it is satisfied of the justice of such course and the concurrence of
the convening officer is signified by the prosecutor and record a special finding.  For
example, if an accused charged with desertion pleads guilty to absence without leave, or if
an accused charged with losing by neglect a number of articles pleads guilty in respect of
some of those articles only, the court may accept such qualified plea and record a special
finding accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 396:
63.
Procedure on acquittal.  If the finding on all the charges is “Not Guilty”, the presiding officer
shall date and sign the finding and such signature shall authenticate the whole of the proceedings,
and the proceedings upon being signed by the judge-advocate (if any) shall be at once transmitted
for confirmation.
NOTE
Even the finding of “not guilty” by a GCM, DCM or SGCM requires confirmation and
is not valid until so confirmed; See AA.s. 153.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 397:
64.
Procedure on conviction.
(1)
If the finding on any charge is “Guilty” then, for the guidance of the court in
determining its sentence, and of the confirming authority in considering the sentence, the
court, before deliberating on its sentence, shall, whenever possible, take evidence of and
record the general character, age, service, rank and any recognized acts of gallantry or
distinguished conduct of the accused, any previous convictions of the accused either by a
court-martial or a criminal court, any previous punishments awarded to him by an officer
exercising authority under Section 80, 83, 84 or 85, as the case may be, the length of time
has been in arrest or in confinement on any previous sentence, and any military decoration,
or military reward, of which he may be in possession or to which he is entitled.
(2)
Evidence on the above matters may be given by a witness verifying a statement
which contains a summary of the entries in the regimental books respecting the accused and
identifying the accused as the person referred to in that summary.
(3)
The accused may cross-examine any such witness, and may call witnesses to rebut
such evidence; and if the accused so requests, the regimental books, or a duly certified copy
of the material entries therein, shall be produced; and if the accused alleges that the
summary is in any respect not in accordance with the regimental books, or such certified
copy, as the case may be, the court shall compare the summary with those books or copy,
and if it finds it is not in accordance there-with, shall cause the summary to be corrected.
(4)
When all the evidence on the above matters has been given, the accused may
address the court thereon and in mitigation of punishment.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 398:
1.
See AA.s. 144 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 399:
2.
The court will always take evidence as to character, unless the circumstances render
it impracticable to do so, in which case it will record upon the proceedings the reasons for
such impracticability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 400:
3.
Evidence upon the matters referred to in this rule should not be given by a member
of the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 401:
4.
The court cannot take oral evidence that the accused is of bad character; this should
be proved in the manner shown in sub-rule (2) ; but oral evidence of good character is
always permissible.  If the accused calls witnesses as to his good character, they may be
cross-examined by the prosecutor with a view to testing their veracity and thereby indirectly
bringing out evidence of bad character.  Witnesses as to character can also be called during
the hearing of the case for the defence and before the finding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 402:
5.
The court will also consider the length of time during which the accused has been in
confinement awaiting trail upon the present charge or charges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 403:
6.
If by reason of the nature of the service of the accused, the finding of the court
renders him liable to any exceptional punishment in addition to that to be awarded by the
sentence of the court, the prosecutor should call the attention of the court to the fact, and
the court should enquire into the nature and amount of such additional punishment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 404:
7.
For definition of “Military reward” , see AA.s. 3(xiv).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 405:
8.
Previous conviction of the accused will be proved by the production of a verbatim
extract from the regimental books (IAFD-905) duly completed by the officer-in-charge of
these books (see note 10 below and AA.s. 142(3) and (4).  The term ‘regimental books’
includes departmental books of the same nature as those maintained by corps, e.g., sheet
roll of a court-martial book, but does not include departmental business books. If there is
any reason to doubt the correctness of the entry in the regimental books of a civil
conviction, such conviction may be proved by an extract certified by person having the
custody of the records of the court in which the accused was convicted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 406:
9.
The witness producing the extract from the regimental books and the statement as
to age, service, rank, etc., of the accused should be the adjutant or some other officer, and
there is no objection to the prosecutor giving such evidence (see note to AR 56).  He must be
sworn as any other witness and may be cross-examined by the accused and questioned by
the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 407:
10.
The copy of the material entries in the regimental book must be certified by the
officer having custody of the original book (AA.s. 142 (4); custody includes temporary
custody for the purpose of the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 408:
65.
Sentence.  The court shall award a single sentence in respect of all the offences of which the
accused is found guilty, and such sentence shall be deemed to be awarded in respect of the offence
in each charge in respect of which it can be legally given and not to be awarded in respect of any
offence in a charge in respect of which it cannot be legally given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 409:
1.
This rule applies whether the charge on which the offender has been tried are
contained in one or several charge-sheets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 410:
2.
As to postponement of sentence where several  persons are tried separately for
offences arising out of the same transaction; see AR 89(4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 411:
3.
The sentence must be a sentence authorized by the AA (see AA.s. 71 to 76) e.g., a
court-martial cannot award a sentence of confinement to lines, or sentence an offender to
restore stolen property.  But a court-martial may  under AA.s. 151(1) make a separate order
for the disposal of property.  Such an order should be recorded below the signature of the
presiding officer to the sentence and should be separately dated and signed by the presiding
officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 412:
4.
For procedure in voting upon the sentence, see AR 87 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 413:
5.
The object of the latter portion of this rule is to prevent legal objection to the
validity of the sentence.  If, for example, an offender has been found guilty by a GCM on a
charge of desertion on active service, and also upon a charge under AA.s. 54(a) for making
away  with arms and equipment, a sentence of death in respect of the first charge will be
valid, although a sentence of 10 years imprisonment  is the maximum sentence which could
have been awarded upon the second charge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 414:
6.
Sentences , unless for one or more years exactly, should if for one month or
upwards, be recorded in months.  Sentences consisting of partly of months and partly of
days should be recorded in months and days.  A month means a calendar month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 415:
7.
Even if the accused is considered by the medical officer, who examines him before
trial unfit to undergo rigorous imprisonment, the court can sentence him to it as it is the
duty of the medical officer of the prison, or place of military custody, to decide what severity
of labour he can undergo.  Sentences of simple imprisonment are inexpedient and
inconvenient of execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 416:
66.
Recommendation to mercy.
(1)
If the court makes a recommendation to mercy, it shall give its reasons for its
recommendation.
(2)
The number of opinions by which the recommendation to mercy mentioned in this
rule, or any question relative thereto, is adopted or rejected, may be entered in the
proceedings.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 417:
1.
A recommendation to mercy will be appended to the sentence; it forms part of the
proceedings of the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 418:
2.
In view of the discretion of the court in the matter of awarding sentence, a
recommendation to mercy will be exceptional.  It will usually be made only when the court,
though unwilling to pass a lenient sentence least the offence should be considered as venial
one, thinks  that, owing to the offender’s character or other exceptional circumstances, he
should not suffer the full penalty which the offence would ordinarily demand.  As a rule the
court will be able to adjust the sentence according to what, in its judgement, the offender
should suffer having regard to the attendant circumstances.  It is indisputable that offences
are more effectually prevented by certainty than by severity of punishment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 419:
3.
As a recommendation to mercy is part of the proceedings, any expression of opinion
in it in relation to the finding must be read with, and as part of the finding.  Accordingly,
where in a recommendation to mercy a court expresses an opinion inconsistent with  the
guilt of the person under sentence, e.g., where the charges is for striking a superior, and the
court states its opinion that the accused “did not intend to strike”, it must be treated as an
acquittal, the intent being an element of the offence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 420:
4.
Recommendation to mercy is a matter which the court has to decide under AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 421:
87(1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 422:
67.
Announcement of sentence and signing and transmission of proceedings.
(1)
The sentence together with any recommendation to mercy and the reasons for any
such recommendation will be announced forthwith in open court.  The sentence will be
announced as subject to confirmation.
(2)
Upon the court awarding the sentence, the presiding officer shall date and sign the
sentence and such signature shall authenticate the whole of the proceedings and the
proceedings upon being signed by the Judge-Advocate (if any), shall at once be transmitted
for confirmation.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 423:
1.
It is essential that the date of the sentence should be inserted as under AA.s. 167 a
term of imprisonment is reckoned to commence on the day on which the sentence and
proceedings were signed by the presiding officer.  When, however, the presiding officer
after recording the finding and sentence, omits to either sign or date the proceedings, he
can, even after confirmation, sign them and date his signature as of the true date of the
decision.  The proceedings must not be signed by the members of the court other than the
presiding officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 424:
2.
The signature authenticates the whole of the proceedings, including the
documentary evidence produced at the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 425:
3.
When an original document is produced in evidence, it will rarely be necessary to
annex it to the proceedings.  A certified copy should be produced to the court, together with
the original, the former being attached to the proceedings, and the later returned to its
proper custodian.  Documents, the actual appearance of which is material to the case (e.g.,
alleged forgeries), shall always be attached in original.
Confirmation and Revision

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 426:
68.
Revision.
(1)
Where the finding is sent back for revision under section 160, the court shall re-
assemble in open court, the revision order shall be read, and if the court is directed to take
fresh evidence, such evidence shall also be taken in open court.
(2)
Except where the court is directed to take fresh evidence, no fresh evidence shall be
adduced.
(3)
The court may, on a request from the prosecutor, in the interest of justice, allow a
witness to be called or re-called for the purpose of rebutting any material statement made
by a witness for the defence during revision.
(4)
After the revision order has been read in open court, whether the revision is of
finding or sentence and the evidence, if any, in accordance with sub-rule (1), (2) and (3) has
been taken, the prosecutor and the accused shall be given a further opportunity to address
the court in the order as laid down in rule 59.  If necessary, the judge-advocate, if any, may
sum up the (additional) evidence and advise the court upon the law relating to the case.  The
court shall then deliberate on its finding or the sentence, as the case may be, in closed court.
(5)
Where the finding is sent back for revision and the court does not adhere to its
former finding, it shall revoke the finding and sentence, and record the new finding, in the
manner laid down in rule 62, and if such new finding involves a sentence, pass sentence
afresh, after complying with rule 64.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 427:
6.
Where the sentence alone is sent back for revision, the court shall not revise the
finding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 428:
7.
After the revision, the presiding officer shall date and sign the decision of the court,
and the proceedings, upon being signed by the judge-advocate, if any, shall at once be
transmitted for confirmation.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 429:
1.
Under the military law in force, a finding of acquittal can be revised and the accused
found guilty and sentenced, a sentence can be increased on revision, the fresh evidence can
(if so ordered) be taken on revision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 430:
2.
A court cannot be re-assembled more than once for revision, whether of finding or
of sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 431:
3.
The object of revision will generally be to cure defects in the finding or sentence, or
both.  The confirming officer, however, by partial confirmation or by exercising his powers
under AR 72(1)  or 73 can often correct mistakes made by the court, and thus obviate the
inconvenience of re-assembling the court for revision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 432:
4.
If the sentence originally awarded by the court is wholly illegal, e.g., a sentence of
rigorous imprisonment awarded to a WO by a DCM, or a sentence of reduction to ranks
awarded to a lance-naik, or a sentence of confinement to lines awarded to a sepoy, it is null
(see note 2 to AR 73), and the court, on revision, may award any legal sentence; in such a
case the confirming officer cannot pass a valid sentence; but see AA.s. 163 for alteration of
sentence after confirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 433:
5.
Where a special finding should have been recorded under AA.s. 139 or AR 62(4), the
finding should be sent back for revision.  A confirming officer cannot substitute a special
finding on any charge for the court’s finding; but see AA.s. 163 for substitution or a finding
after confirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 434:
6.
If a court brings in a finding of “not guilty” against the weight of evidence, the court
may be re-assembled and the confirming officer may give his views on the evidence,
directing the attention of the court to any special points which it appears to have failed to
appreciate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 435:
7.
A finding of insanity may also be sent back for revision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 436:
8.
A confirming officer cannot sent back part of a finding or sentence: if he thinks that a
part only requires revision, he must return the whole, pointing out the part which, in his
opinion, requires revision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 437:
9.
The court should be re-assembled as soon as practicable.  If the court upon re-
assembly is reduced, by death or otherwise, below the legal minimum [see AA.s. 160(2) and
(3)], it cannot proceed with the revision, and the proceedings must be returned to the
confirming authority.  In such cases, as no revision has taken place, the original finding and
sentence will stand and will be dealt with by the confirming authority.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 438:
10.
Under AA.s. 167, the term of imprisonment commences on the date of the original
sentence.  Also see notes to AA.s. 167.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 439:
11.
Where the finding is sent back for revision and the court adheres to the finding, it
can nevertheless revise the sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 440:
12.
If the revised finding is an acquittal or a finding of insanity, no sentence is involved.
If a court, on revision, revokes its original finding on any charge, the original sentence, if any,
automatically falls to the ground, and, if the revised finding entails a sentence, the court
must pass sentence afresh; if the court omits to do so, the accused is not legally under any
sentence and the confirming officer may return the proceedings with directions to the court
to complete the revision and pass sentence.  This will not be a second revision, which is
prohibited by AA.s. 160(1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 441:
13.
If the original finding was acquittal and the revised finding is “Guilty”, the court will
(whether ordered to take fresh evidence or not) proceed as directed by AR 64.  The evidence
referred to in sub-rule (1) is evidence of the facts relating to the charge, and must not be
taken on revision unless specially ordered AA.s. 160(1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 442:
69.
Review of court-martial proceedings.   The proceedings of a general court-martial shall be
submitted by the judge-advocate at the trial for review to the deputy or assistant judge-advocate
general of the command who shall then forward it to the confirming officer.  The proceedings of a
district court-martial shall be sent by the presiding officer or the judge-advocate direct to the
confirming officer who must, in all cases, where the sentence is dismissal or above, seek advice of
the deputy or assistant judge-advocate general of the command before confirmation.
NOTE
This rule provides for a statutory review of all GCM proceedings and of DCM
proceedings where the sentence awarded is dismissal or above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 443:
70.
Confirmation.  Upon receiving the proceedings of a general or district court-martial, the
confirming authority may confirm or refuse confirmation, or, reserve confirmation for superior
authority, and the confirmation, non-confirmation, or reservation shall be entered in and form part
of the proceedings.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 444:
1.
See AA.ss. 153 to 159 and ARs 72 to 74.  As to confirmation of SGCM proceedings,
see AA.s. 157 and AR 162.

Chunk 445:
2.
The minute of reservation should be entered in the proceedings.

Chunk 446:
3.
Sentence of death must be reserved for confirmation by the Central Government.
See warrants A-2  and A-3 for confirmation of GCM proceedings and AA.s. 156 and notes
thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 447:
4.
Confirmation is complete when proceedings are promulgated to the accused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 448:
71.
Promulgation.   The charge, finding, and sentence, and any recommendation to mercy shall,
together with the confirmation  or non-confirmation of the proceedings, be promulgated in such
manner as the confirming authority may direct; and if no direction is given, according to the custom
of the service. Until promulgation has been effected, confirmation is not complete and the finding
and sentence shall not be held to have been confirmed until they have been promulgated.

1.
For the date from which a sentence of cashiering or dismissal takes effect, see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 450:
168.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 451:
2.
In the absence of any direction by the confirming authority, the usual custom of the
service as to promulgation will be followed, but a written notice to the offender of the
charge, etc., will be sufficient promulgation under this rule.  Also see Regs Army para 472.

As to committal to a civil prison or to military custody of persons sentenced to
imprisonment, see AA.s. 169; as to action in exceptional cases, see AA.s. 171.

Chunk 455:
72.
Mitigation of sentence on partial confirmation.
(1)
Where a sentence has been awarded by a court-martial in respect of offences in
several charges, and the confirming authority confirms the finding on some but not on all
such charges, the authority shall take into consideration the fact of such non-confirmation,
and shall, if it seems just mitigate, remit, or commute the punishment awarded according as
it seems just, having regard to the offences in the charges in respect of the findings which
are confirmed.
(2)
Where  a sentence has been awarded by a court-martial in respect of offences in
several charges and has been confirmed and any one of such charges or the finding thereon
is found to be invalid, the authority having poser to mitigate, remit, or commute the
punishment awarded by the sentence shall take into consideration the fact of such invalidity,
and if it seems just, mitigate, remit or commute the punishment awarded according as it
seems just, having regard to the offences in the charges which with the findings thereon are
not invalid, and the punishment as so modified shall be as valid as if it had been originally
awarded only in respect of those offences.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 456:
1.
As to the meaning of the terms mitigation, remission and commutation, see notes
to AA.s. 158.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 457:
2.
Where a sepoy  has been convicted of (a) desertion on active service under AA.s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 458:
38(1) and (b) of theft of government property under AA.s. 52 (a), and has been sentenced to
rigorous imprisonment for 14 years; and the confirming officer confirms the finding on the
second charge but not that on the first which alone justified the sentence of 14 years
rigorous imprisonment, he is bound under this rule to remit the sentence at least to rigorous
imprisonment for 10 years, which is the maximum sentence under AA.s. 52 (a).  If, however,
the confirming officer confirms the finding of the first charge and not that on the second, he
may mitigate or commute it to some less punishment, if he considers that a sentence of
rigorous imprisonment for 14 years on the first charge alone is, in the circumstances, too
severe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 459:
3.
Sub-rule (2) gives to the authority prescribed under AA.s. 179 similar powers to do
after confirmation that which under sub-rule (1) the confirming officer may do before
confirmation.  But it will be not it will be noted that the prescribed authority is only required
to act under sub-rule (2) where any one of the charges, or the finding thereon, is found to be
invalid and has been set aside.  The prescribed authority derives the ordinary powers of
mitigation etc., from AA.s. 179.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 460:
4.
As to substitution of a valid for an invalid sentence, see AA.s. 163.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 461:
73.
Confirmation notwithstanding informality in or excess of punishment.  If the sentence of a
court-martial is informally expressed, the confirming authority may, in confirming the sentence, vary
the form so that it shall be properly expressed; and if the punishment awarded by the sentence is in
excess of the punishment authorized by law, the confirming authority may vary the sentence so that
the sentence shall not be in excess of the punishment authorised by law; and the confirming
authority may confirm the finding and the sentence, as so varied, of the court-martial.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 462:
1.
The object of this rule is to prevent the proceedings of court-martial from being
rendered invalid when they cannot be sent back for revision without great inconvenience to
the public service.  It will not exonerate from blame the presiding officers and members of
courts-martial who award sentences which are informal or in excess of their powers.  If
confirming officers decide to act under this rule, instead of ordering a revision of the
sentence, they should call the attention of the members of the court to the informality or
irregularity of the sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 463:
2.
The confirming authority cannot under this rule vary a sentence which is illegal in its
character and therefore null e.g., a sentence of imprisonment awarded by a DCM to a WO or
a sentence of reduction awarded to a lance-naik or a sentence of confinement to lines
awarded to a sepoy.  In such cases the court must be reassembled for the purpose of passing
a valid sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 464:
74.
Member or prosecutor not to confirm proceedings.  A member of a court-martial, or an
officer who has acted as a prosecutor at a court-martial, shall not confirm the finding or sentence of
that court-martial, and where such member or prosecutor becomes confirming officer, he shall refer
the finding the sentence of the court-martial to a superior authority competent to confirm the
findings and sentences of the like description of court-martial.
NOTES
If proceedings are confirmed in error by an officer not having power to confirm, his
act and the subsequent promulgation are null, and it is open to the proper authority to
confirm them.
Proceedings of General and District Court-Martial

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 465:
75.
Seating of members.  The members of a court-martial shall take their seats according to
their army rank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 466:
76.
Responsibility of presiding officer.
(1)
The presiding officer is responsible for the trial being conducted in proper order, and
in accordance with the Act, rules made thereunder and in a manner befitting a court of
justice.
(2)
It is the duty of the presiding officer to see that justice is administered, that the
accused has a fair trial, and that he does not suffer any disadvantage in consequence of his
position as a person under trial, or of his ignorance, or of his incapacity to examine or cross-
examine witnesses, or otherwise.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 467:
1.
The court should always have at its disposal the AA, AR, Regs Army and other official
books or orders which are necessary for the purpose of its proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 468:
2.
The presiding officer should be careful to safeguard the dignity of the court and the
solemnity of its proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 469:
3.
If any person, other than the accused, interrupts the proceedings, he should
ordinarily be excluded from the court.  The court has, however, further posers under AR 150
for dealing with persons who interrupt its proceedings.  See also AA.s. 152 and notes
thereto.  The trial of a person cannot proceed in his absence, even though he interrupts the
proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 470:
4.
If the accused is not represented by counsel or defending of officer, the presiding
officer should assist him in putting forward his defence, and take care that he is not
prejudiced by his inability to put proper questions to the witnesses or bring out clearly the
points upon which he relies.  If there is a JA, he has a similar duty (AR 105(7)), but the
presence of a JA does not relieve the presiding officer of his responsibility under this rule.  If
a witness gives evidence different from that given by him when the summary of evidence
was taken, he should be questioned as to the difference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 471:
5.
The presiding officer should always put to the witness any questions which appear
to him necessary or desirable for the purpose of eliciting the truth; see AR 143 and notes
thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 472:
77.
Power of court over address of prosecutor and accused.
(1)
It is the duty of the prosecutor to assist the court in the administration of justice, to
be have impartially, to bring the whole of the transaction before the court, and not to take
any unfair advantage of, or suppress any evidence in favour of, the accused.
(2)
The prosecutor may not refer to any matter, not relevant to the charge or charges
then before the court and it is the duty of the court to stop him from so doing and also
restrain any undue violence of language or want of fairness or moderation on the part of the
prosecutor.
(3)
The court shall allow great latitude to the accused in making his defence; he must
abstain from any remarks contemptuous or disrespectful towards the court, and from coarse
and insulting language towards others, but he may for the purpose of his defence impeach
the evidence and the motives of the witnesses and the prosecutor, and charge other persons
with blame and even criminality, subject, if he does so, to any liability which he may thereby
incur.  The court may caution the accused as to the irrelevance of this defence, but shall not,
unless in special cases, stop his defence solely on ground of such irrelevance.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 473:
1.
As to the duties of the prosecutor, see memoranda on page 437.  As to the address
by the prosecutor, see AR 56, 58, 59 and 78.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 474:
2.
The prosecutor is an officer whose duty, it is to see that justice is done and not a
partisan intent on securing a conviction independently of the justice of the case.  He should,
therefore, put before the courts facts which show the true character of the offence, and
must be careful to prove affirmatively any facts tending to show the innocence of the
accused or extenuate his offence, e.g., he should himself produce any available evidence of
provocation which might mitigate punishment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 475:
3.
It occasionally happens that a sepoy charged with desertion was to the knowledge
of the prosecutor, arrested or rendered an involuntary absentee at a date earlier that the
termination of his absence as alleged in the particulars of the charge.  In such circumstances
it is the duty of the prosecutor, although he has not direct evidence to prove the earlier
termination of the absence, to tell the court the information which he possesses, and to
invite them to act upon such information by recording a special finding under AR 62(4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 476:
4.
The prosecutor must not introduce matters of aggravation into the evidence against
the accused unless they are relevant to the charge against him. Generally speaking, anything
which tends to show that the accused committed the offence charged, or to show the true
character of the offence, is relevant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 477:
5.
As to the latitude to be given to the accused in making his defence, see notes to AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 478:
58.  If the accused charges other persons with blame or criminality, the court should caution
him that he may be incurring a liability to be charged subsequently with knowingly making a
false accusation.  (AA.s.56(a)).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 479:
6.
The case must be very special indeed to justify the court in stopping the accused in
his defence, or in excluding on the ground of irrelevancy, evidence offered by him, or to
justify any further proceedings against him on account of his defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 480:
78.
Procedure on trial of accused persons together.  Where two or more accused persons are
tried together and any evidence as to the facts of the case is tendered by any one or more or them,
the evidence and address on the part of or on behalf of all the accused persons shall be taken before
the prosecutor replies, and the prosecutor shall make one address only in reply as regards all the
accused persons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 481:
79.
Separate charge-sheets.
(1)
The convening officer may direct any charges against an accused person to be
inserted in different charge-sheets, and when he so directs, the accused shall be arraigned
and until after the finding tried, upon each charge-sheet separately, and the procedure in
rules 48 to 62, both inclusive, shall, until after finding, be followed in respect of each charge-
sheet, as if it contained the whole of the charges against the accused.
(2)
The trials upon the several charge-sheets shall be in such order as the convening
officer directs.
(3)
When the court have tried the accused upon all the charge-sheets they shall, in the
case of the finding being “Not guilty” on all the charges, proceed as directed by rule 63, and
in case of the finding on any one or more of the charges being “Guilty” proceed as directed
by rules 54 and 64 to 67, both inclusive, in like manner in each case as if all the charges in
the different charge-sheets had been contained in one charge-sheet, and the sentence
passed shall be of the same effect as if all the charges had been contained in one charge-
sheet.
(4)
If the convening officer directs that, in the event of the conviction of an accused
person upon a charge in any charge-sheet , he need not be tried upon the subsequent
charge-sheets the court in such event may, without trying the accused upon any of the
subsequent charge-sheets proceed as provided in sub-rule (3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 482:
5.
Where a charge-sheet contains more than one charge, the accused may, before
pleading, claim to be tried separately in respect of any charge or charges in that charge-
sheet, on the ground that he will be embarrassed in his defence if he is no so tried
separately; and in such case the court, unless they think his claim unreasonable, shall arraign
and try the accused in like manner as if the convening officer had inserted the said charge or
charges in different charge-sheets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 483:
6.
If a plea of “Guilty”, to any charge in a charge-sheet has been recorded as the finding
of the court, the provisions of sub-rule (3) and (4) of rule 54 shall not be complied with until
after the court had arrived at its finding on all the charge-sheets.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 484:
1.
Most of the ordinary cases which come before courts-martial are so simple in their
facts that an accused person is not likely to be embarrassed by being tried upon several
charges at the same time.  But if the charges are complicated, or if the alleged offences were
committed at different times, or if different sets of witnesses are required to prove the
different charges, embarrassment is likely  to arise, and in such cases the convening officer
should cause the charges to be inserted in separate charge-sheets, numbered consecutively
in the order in which he directs them to be tried.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 485:
2.
It is difficult to lay down for the guidance of convening officers any definite rules as
to the placing of the charges in different charges; much will depend upon the circumstances
of each particular case.  But the following general principles may be laid down:-
(a)
Alternative charges must not be placed in different charge-sheets.
(b)
A series of offences forming part of one escapade should normally be placed
in a single charge-sheet, e.g., escape from custody following by resistance to escort
upon re-arrest and gross insubordination to the guard commander after re-
committal to confinement.  Multiplicity of charges arising out of the same
transaction should, however, be avoided, though in some cases it is necessary to
allege a series of offences, e.g., to prove some particular intent, or to guide the court
in determining the proper punishment to be awarded.
(c)
Repeated instance of offences of the same or similar character should be
included in a single charge-sheet; e.g., a series of barrack-room thefts from
comrades during a short space of time.
(d)
Offences of different description should be entered in separate charge-
sheets except where they form part of or are relevant to one transaction, or where
the facts of each case are simple, e.g., where a soldier is charged with desertion and
with using criminal force to his superior officer after he had been handed over to the
escort, the charges should normally be inserted in separate charge-sheets, unless
the facts are simple.  But if immediately before the alleged desertion, accused made
away with his Army clothing, a charge in respect of the latter offence is relevant to
the intent of the accused in leaving his unit and should be inserted in the same
charge-sheet as the charge of desertion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 486:
3.
Even if the convening officer has directed all charges to be inserted in a single
charge-sheet, the accused under sub-rule (5) has the right to apply for separate trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 487:
4.
Where the accused is arraigned on separate charge-sheets, the court must arrive at
its finding upon one charge-sheet before the next charge-sheet is proceeded with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 488:
5.
Where any evidence given upon the trial of an accused on one charge-sheet is
required to be given on the trial of the same accused person on a subsequent charge-sheet,
it must be given afresh, but the witness giving such evidence need not be sworn/affirmed
again, but he should be reminded of his previous oath/affirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 489:
6.
Generally speaking, the convening officer will regulate the order for the trial of
different charge-sheets according to the date of the respective offences.  But where the
gravity of the various offences differs, it may be desirable to insert the charge involving the
gravest offence in the first charge-sheet, as, if the accused is convicted, he will be sufficiently
punished without trying him in respect of the minor offences; see sub-rule (4).  Occasionally
it will be desirable to direct that a charge which necessitates the calling of a large number of
witnesses should be inserted in the first charge-sheet, so that the attendance of such
witnesses can be dispensed with after the trial on that charge-sheet has been completed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 490:
7.
After the finding of the court upon all the charge-sheets has been arrived at, the
procedure will be the same as if all the charges had been inserted in one charge-sheet.
Unless, therefore, the convening officer directs that the accused need not be tried upon any
subsequent charge-sheet, the court will not proceed to sentence until it has arrived at a
finding on all the charge-sheets, and will then award one sentence in respect of all of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 491:
8.
It will often be unnecessary, if the accused is convicted of a grave charge contained
in one charge-sheet, to proceed with any other or minor offences contained in the other
charge-sheets.  On the other hand, it may be desirable to try the upon the other charge-
sheets in order that a more severe sentence may be awarded, if justified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 492:
9.
The powers given to the convening officer under sub-rule (4) cannot be exercised by
the prosecutor on his own initiative or by the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 493:
10.
The court should always, unless it thinks the claim to be unreasonable, accede to a
demand to be tried separately in respect of any particular charge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 494:
11.
Under sub-rule (6) where an accused has pleaded guilty to a charge entered in one
of several charge-sheets, the summary or abstract of evidence relating thereto and any
statement which he may make in reference to the charge or in mitigation of punishment will
not be read or recorded until after the finding of the court on all the charge-sheets has been
arrived at.  But for this provision, the fair trial of the accused upon the other charge-sheets
might be prejudiced, especially if he stated, in mitigation of punishment, anything which
might point to his guilt on any charge in a charge-sheet which has not yet been tried.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 495:
80.
Sitting in closed court.
(1)
A court-martial, where it is so directed by these rules, and may in any other case on
any deliberation amongst the members, sit in closed court.
(2)
No person shall be present in closed court except the members of the court, the
judge-advocate (if nay) and any officers under jurisdiction.
(3)
For the purpose of giving effect to the foregoing provisions of this rule, the court-
martial may either retire or cause the place where they sit to be cleared of all other persons
not entitled to be present.
(4)
Except as hereinbefore mentioned all proceedings, including the view of any place,
shall be in open court and in the presence of the accused subject to sub-rule (5).
(5)
The court shall have the power to exclude from the court any witness who has yet to
give evidence or any other person, other than the accused, who interferes with its
proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 496:
80A.
Courts Martial to be public.  Subject to rule 80, the place in which a court martial is held for
the purpose of trying an offence under the act shall be deemed to be an open court to which the
public generally may have access, so far as the same can conveniently contain them:
Provided that, if the court is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient in the public interest
or for the ends of justice so to do, the court may at any stage of the trial or any particular case order
that the public generally or any portion thereof or any particular person shall not have access to, or
be or remain in, the place in which the court is held.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 497:
1.
If more convenient, the court may withdraw for deliberations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 498:
2.
All the members of the court, and the JA, where one is appointed, must be present
in the closed court.  The officers under instructions should also be present.  If for any reason
an officer under instruction is not present to attend the deliberations in closed court, his
absence will not affect the validity of such deliberations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 499:
3.
All the members of the court, the JA where one is appointed, and the accused must
be present at the “view”.  The prosecutor, and the defence counsel or defending officer
should also be present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 500:
4.
This rule does not affect the power of the court to exclude any person, other than
the accused, who interferes with the proceedings; a power which every court possess for the
proper conduct of its proceedings.  A court-martial has inherent power to sit “in camera” if
necessary for the proper administration of justice.  A court-martial may sit “in camera” if
evidence of a secret or top secret nature is led at the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 501:
81.
Hours of sitting.
(1)
A court-martial may sit at such times and for such period between the hours of six in
the morning and six in the afternoon as may be directed by the proper superior military
authority, and so far as no such direction extends, as the court from time to time determines
but no court shall sit for more than six hours in any one time.
(2)
If the court consider it necessary to continue the trial after six in the afternoon or to
sit for more than six hours in any one day, it may do so but if it does so should record in the
proceedings the reason for so doing.
(3)
In case requiring an immediate example or when the convening officer certified
under his hand that it is expedient for the public service, trials may be held at any hour.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 502:
4.
If the court or the convening officer or other superior military authority thinks that
military exigencies or the interests of discipline require the court to sit on Sunday or on any
other day declared as a holiday in Army or Command Orders, the court may sit accordingly,
but otherwise the court shall not sit on any of those days.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 503:
1.
Reasons for longer sittings of the court or for sittings outside the hours specified in
sub-rule (1)  should be recorded in the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 504:
2.
When the court sits on a Sunday or a gazetted holiday, the reasons for so doing
should also be recorded in the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 505:
82.
Continuity of trial and adjournment of court.
(1)
When a court is once assembled and the accused has been arraigned the court shall
continue the trial from day to day, in accordance with rule 81, unless it appears to the court
that an adjournment is necessary for the ends of justice or that such continuance is
impracticable.
(2)
A court may adjourn from time to time and from place to place and may, when
necessary, view any place.
(3)
The senior officer on the spot may also, for military exigencies adjourn or prolong
the adjournment of the court.
(4)
A court-martial, in the absence of a judge-advocate (if such has been appointed for
that court-martial) shall not proceed, and shall adjourn.
(5)
If the time to which an adjournment is made is not specified, the adjournment shall
be until further orders from the proper military authority; and, if the place to which an
adjournment is made is not specified in further orders from the proper military authority.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 506:
1.
It is very important that a trial, once begun should proceed without interruption to
its conclusion.  This rule, therefore, requires the court to sit from day to day unless an
adjournment is necessary for the ends of justice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 507:
2.
Apart from specific provisions under the AR, an adjournment should be allowed for
obtaining the opinion of the confirming authority or of the DJAG/AJAG of the command on
any point of law or procedure, for enabling the accused to prepare his defence, the
prosecutor to prepare his reply or the JA to prepare his summing-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 508:
3.
The court should not, as a rule, permit an adjournment to enable the prosecutor to
call new witnesses, unless the necessity for their presence at the trial could not reasonably
have been foreseen.  The court should adjourn if it considers that the accused has not had
sufficient opportunity for procuring the attendance of any witnesses whom he desires to
call, or where it would be unjust to the accused not so to adjourn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 509:
4.
The reasons for any adjournment must be entered in the proceedings, and either
announced in court in presence of the accused, or communicated to the prosecutor and
accused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 510:
5.
Prolonged sittings unduly strain the attention of members of the court and may
operate unfairly upon the accused, who should never be required to make his defence at the
close of a prolonged sitting.  See AR 81.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 511:
6.
Where civilian witnesses are present, the court should, if reasonably possible,
complete their evidence before adjourning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 512:
7.
Sub-rule (2) meets the case where a “view” is necessary, or where a court-martial is
held on the line of march, or where an adjournment to a hospital for the purpose of taking
the evidence of a sick witness is rendered necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 513:
8.
As to “view”, see AR 80 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 514:
9.
The military exigencies referred to in sub-rule (3) can seldom occur except on active
service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 515:
10.
As to procedure on death of JA or his inability to attend, see AR 104.  Where the
absence of the JA is due to temporary cause, the court should adjourn until he is able to
attend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 516:
83.
Suspension of trial.
(1)
Where, in consequence of anything arising while the court is sitting, the court is
unable by reason of dissolution as specified in section 117, or otherwise, to continue the
trial, the presiding officer or, in his absence, the senior member, present, will immediately
report the facts to the convening authority.
(2)
Where a court-martial is dissolved before the finding, or, in case of a finding of
guilty, before the award of the sentence, the entire proceedings before the court-martial
shall be null and the accused may be tried before another court-martial.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 517:
1.
See AA.s.117 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 518:
2.
As to substitution of JA, see AR 104.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 519:
3.
When a court is dissolved under sub-rule (2), every member thereof will be
disqualified to sit as a member of the fresh court convened for the trial of the accused; see
AR 39(2)(c).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 520:
84
Proceedings on death or illness of accused.   In case of the death of the accused, or of such
illness of the accused as renders it impossible to continue the trial, the court shall ascertain the fact
of the death or illness by evidence, and record the same and adjourn, and transmit the proceedings
to the convening authority.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 521:
1.
See AA.s. 117(2).  “Impossible to continue” means to continue within a reasonable
time having regard to all the circumstances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 522:
2.
Oral evidence of the fact of the death or illness will be taken on oath or affirmation.
Also, a medical certificate should always, where possible be obtained, stating that the illness
of the accused renders his presence in court impracticable, or dangerous to himself or
others, and also the time when, in the opinion of the medical officer, the accused will be
able to be present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 523:
85.
Death, retirement or absence of presiding officer.   In the case of the death, retirement on
challenge or unavoidable absence of the presiding officer, the next senior officer shall take the place
of the presiding officer and the trial shall proceed if the court is still composed of not less than the
minimum number of officers of which it is required by law to consist.
NOTE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 524:
1.
See AA.s. 117 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 525:
86.
Presence throughout of all members of court.
(1)
A member of a court who has absent while any part of the evidence on the trial of
an accused person is taken, shall take no further part in the trial by that court of that person,
but the court will not be affected unless it is reduced below the legal minimum.
(2)
An officer shall not be added to a court-martial after the accused has been
arraigned.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 526:
1.
See AA.s. 117 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 527:
2.
As to arraignment, see AR and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 528:
87.
Taking of opinions of members of court.
(1)
Every member of a court must give his opinion by word of mouth on every question
which the court has to decide, and must give his opinion as to the sentence, notwithstanding
that he has given his opinion in favour of acquittal.
(2)
The opinion of the members of the court shall be taken in succession, beginning with
the member lowest in rank.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 529:
1.
Opinions must be given orally; see AR 61(2).  The oath or affirmation taken by
members of the court operates, save as therein provided, to prevent the opinions of
individual members from being disclosed; see AR 45.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 530:
2.
AA.s. 132 (1) required all decisions to be passed by an absolute majority, except in
the case of a sentence of death passed by a GCM which requires a two-third majority (AA.s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 531:
132 (2)) and  a sentence of death passed by SGCM which requires the concurrence of all the
members (AA.s. 132(3).  The presiding officer has no second or casting vote in the case of a
sentence of death; not where there is an equality of vote of challenge, finding or sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 532:
3.
In order to obtain an absolute majority in respect of the sentence, every member
must vote, even if he had voted for an acquittal on the finding.  It is desirable that the nature
of the punishment to be awarded should first be considered.
The procedure to be adopted will best be illustrated by the following example:-
At a GCM consisting of seven members, three are in favour of a sentence of
imprisonment for life, two in favour of imprisonment, and two in favour of dismissal
(without imprisonment).  The most lenient punishment will be first put to the vote and will
be rejected by 5 votes to 2.  The next most lenient punishment will then be put to the vote,
viz., imprisonment.  All seven members must vote again and the two members who had
previously voted in favour of dismissal will naturally give their votes for imprisonment rather
than imprisonment for life.  The result will be absolute majority of 4 votes to 3 in favour of
imprisonment.  The quantum or length of the imprisonment to be awarded will be arrived at
in the same manner, the most lenient proposal being put to the vote first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 533:
4.
It is improper to strike an average between the various sentences suggested by the
members of the court, but it may often happen that, in the course of further discussion,
members who had originally made different proposals will arrive at a unanimous decision as
to the proper sentence to be awarded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 534:
5.
The opinion of each member on the finding must be taken separately upon each
charge upon which the accused is arraigned [see AR 61(2)].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 535:
6.
“lowest in rank” means lowest in the rank in which members take their seats; see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 536:
75.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 537:
88.
Procedure on incidental questions.   If any objection is raised on any matter of law,
evidence, or procedure by the prosecutor or by or on behalf of the accused during the trial, the
prosecutor or the accused or counsel or the defending officer (as the case may be) shall have a right
to answer the same and the person raising the objection shall have a right of reply.
NOTE
This rule will apply to such questions as the admissibility of evidence, the propriety
of any question or the recalling of a witness.  It will also apply to a submission, which may
always be made by or on behalf of the accused at the close of the case for the prosecution,
that no case has been made out justifying the court in putting the accused upon his defence;
see note to AR 57.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 538:
89.
Swearing of court to try several accused persons.
(1)
A court may  be sworn or affirmed at one time to try any number of accused persons
then present before it, whether those persons are to be tried collectively or separately, and
each accused person shall have power to object to the members of the court, and shall be
asked separately whether he objects to any member.
(2)
In the case of several accused persons to be tried separately, the court, upon one of
those persons objecting to a member, may, according as it thinks fit, proceed to determine
that objection or postpone the case of that person and swear or affirm the members of the
court for the trial of the others alone.
(3)
In the case of several accused persons to be tried separately, the court when sworn
or affirmed, shall proceed with one case postponing the other cases, and taking them
afterwards in succession.
(4)
Where several accused persons are tried separately by the same court upon charges
arising out of the same transaction, the court may, if it considers it to be desirable in the
interest of justice, postpone consideration of any sentence to be awarded to any one or
more of such accused persons until the trials of all such accused persons have been
completed.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 539:
1.
Notwithstanding that, under this rule, the members of the court, are sworn only
once to try the persons before them, they will constitute a separate court for the trial of
each case, and the swearing of the court will be mentioned in the proceedings of each case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 540:
2.
When, in consequence of an objection raised by one or several persons jointly
charged, a new officer serves, the other accused persons, who had previously raised no
objection to the members of the court, will have the right to object to the new officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 541:
3.
Where two or more accused persons are tried separately by the same court and the
objection of one accused to a member is allowed, that member must still sit as a member of
the court for the trial of the accused who did not object to be tried by him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 542:
4.
The finding and sentence (except where the court decides to act under sub-rule (4)
must be arrived at before the next case is tried.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 543:
5.
It is very desirable that the court should, where several persons are separately tried
and convicted in respect of the same transaction, be in a position to apportion the proper
sentences to be awarded to all the accused persons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 544:
6.
In as much as a sentence of imprisonment will under AA. s. 167 commence upon the
day upon which it is eventually signed, the court, in awarding sentence, should take into
consideration in favour of an accused person any postponement of sentence which has been
occasioned through the operation of sub-rule (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 545:
90.
Swearing of interpreter and shorthand writer.
(1)
At any time during the trial an impartial person may, if the court thinks it necessary
and shall, if either the prosecutor or the accused requests it on any reasonable ground, be
sworn or affirmed to act as interpreter.
(2)
Am impartial person may at any time of the trial, if the court thinks it desirable, be
sworn or affirmed to act as a shorthand writer.
(3)
Before a person is sworn or affirmed as an interpreter or shorthand writer the
accused shall be informed of the person who is proposed to be sworn or affirmed, and may
object to the person as not being impartial or for any reasonable course; and the court, if it
thinks that the objection is reasonable, shall not swear or affirm that persons as interpreter
or shorthand writer.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 546:
1.
An interpreter or shorthand writer is usually sworn or affirmed after the
commencement of the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 547:
2.
For the occasions when an interpreter must be employed see AR 91.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 548:
3.
An interpreter may either be appointed by the convening authority (AR 37(3) or by
the court under this rule.  If a member of the court is appointed interpreter, he must take
the interpreter’s oath or affirmation in addition to the oath/affirmation prescribed for a
member of the court in AR 45.  A member of JA should not normally act as an interpreter
where the trial is likely to be prolonged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 549:
4.
For form of oath and affirmation see  AR 46.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 550:
5.
The accused has a right to object to the shorthand writer or the interpreter.  When
such an objection is raised, the same procedure will be followed as in the case of an
objection to a member of the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 551:
91.
Evidence to be translated.
When any evidence is given in a language which any of the
officers composing the court, the judge- advocate, the prosecutor or the accused, or his defending
officer or counsel does not understand, that the evidence shall be interpreted to such officer or
counsel does not understand, that evidence shall be interpreted to such officer or person in a
language which he knows understand.  If an interpreter in such language has been appointed by the
convening officer, and duly sworn of affirmed, the evidence shall be interpreted by him.  If no such
interpreter has been appointed and sworn or affirmed by the court as required by rule 90.  When
documents are put in for purpose of formal proof, it shall be in the discretion of the court to cause a
much to be interpreted a s appears necessary.
As the charge–sheet and documentary evidence as to character will be in English, an
interpreter in the language of the accused person should be appointed in every case in
which the accused does not know enough  English to understand these documents.
Whoever interprets any evidence must be sworn or affirmed as an interpreter before doing
so, See AR 90 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 552:
92.
Record in proceedings of transaction of court-martial.
(1)
At a court-martial the judge-advocate, or, if there is none, the presiding officer shall
record, or cause to be recorded  in the Hindi or English language, all transactions of the
court, and shall be responsible for the accuracy of the record (in these rules referred to as
the proceedings) ; and if the judge-advocate is called as a witness by the accused, the
presiding officer shall be responsible for the accuracy of the record in the proceedings of the
evidence of the judge-advocate.
(2)
The evidence shall be taken down  in the narrative form in as nearly as possible the
words used, but in any case where the prosecutor, the accused person, the judge-advocate,
or the court considers it material, the question and answer shall be taken verbatim.
(3)
Where an objection has been taken to any question or to the admission of the
evidence or to the procedure of  the court,  such objection shall, if the prosecutor or accused
so requests or the court thinks fit,  be entered upon  the proceedings together with the
grounds of the objection and the decision of the court thereon.
(4)
Where any address by, or on behalf of, the prosecutor the accused, is not in writing,
it shall not be necessary to record the sam4 in the proceedings further or otherwise than the
court thinks proper, except that :-
(a)
the court shall in every case make such record of the defence made by the
accused as will enable the confirming officer to judge of the reply made by, or on
behalf of, the accused to each charge against him; and
(b)
the court shall also  record any particular matters in the address by or on
behalf of, the prosecutor or the accused which the prosecutor or the accused, as the
case may be, may require.
(5)
The court shall not enter in the proceedings any comment or anything not before
the court, or any report of any fact not forming part of the trial, but if any such comment or
report seems to the court necessary, the court may forward it to the proper military
authority in a separate document, signed by the presiding officer.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 553:
1.
The  record, where no shorthand writer is employed, must be taken in a clear and
legible hand and should be typed.  Interlineations and corrections must be avoided as much
as possible;  if made they should be initialed by the presiding officer or JA, if any. If desired, a
typed copy may be substituted for the original manuscript record; if so substituted it must
be checked with the original by the officer responsible for the accuracy of the proceedings.
The pages should be numbered and the various sheets fastened together, sheets not used
being removed. Sufficient space must be left below these signature of the presiding officer
for the decision of the confirming authority.  The  place and date of the signing of the
sentence by the presiding officer must be inserted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 554:
2.
No corrections or additions may be made to the proceedings of a court-martial after
promulgation.  When  an obvious oversight has been made in the record, such as the
omission of the words, “the presiding officer and members are duly sworn/affirmed”.  A
certificate, signed by the presiding officer, to the effect that they were duly sworn/affirmed
should be attached.  But see note 1 to AR 67 as to signing and dating the sentence after
promulgation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 555:
3.
While recording evidence in the narrative form, the material effect of the question
and answer will be written down; e.g., where the question is “what did the accused to
next”? and the answer is “HE left the room”; the evidence as recorded, would read, “The
accused then left the room”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 556:
4.
Documentary evidence will be read by the presiding office or JA, if any,; it should
then be marked with a distinguishing letter or figure and attached to the proceedings. In
many cases it will be sufficient to attach copies of documents which must, however, be
compared with the originals by the court and certified under the hand of the presiding
officer to be true copies (see note 3 to AR 67).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 557:
5.
If a shorthand writer is employed the evidence is usually taken down verbatim by
him.  If the evidence of a witness is not given in English, the material effect of question and
answer interpreted in English will be recorded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 558:
6.
Sub-rule (2) applies to questions and answers given in cross-examination and re-
examination as well as in examination-in-chief.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 559:
7.
The court can make in a separate document any remark it thinks proper on the
conduct of any person who appeared before it, or on the manner in which a particular
witness has given his evidence, or on the  in which the  prosecution has been conducted;
also, if it thinks the evidence shows that the accused has committed some offence not
charged; e.g., if he is charged with desertion in August, and the evidence shows that he
deserted in June, it must acquit him, but may report separately the offence of June.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 560:
8.
The court can scarcely be too guarded in expressing censure on individuals not
before it for trial; indeed, cases justifying such expression will be rare and exceptional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 561:
9.
It will usually be desirable to make a separate note at the time of any matter upon
which the court intends to make any such comments or report; although it will not be
correct to enter such matter in the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 562:
93.
Custody and inspection of proceedings.  The proceedings shall be deemed to be in the
custody of the judge-advocate (if any), or, if there is none,  of the presiding officer but may, with
proper precaution for their safety, be inspected by the members of the court, the prosecutor and
accused, respectively, at all reasonable time before the court is closed to consider the finding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 563:
94.
Transmission of proceedings after finding.   The proceedings shall be at once sent by the
person having the custody thereof to such person as may be directed by the order convening the
court, or, in default of any such direction, to the confirming officer.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 564:
1.
As to custody of the proceedings, see AR 93.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 565:
2.
For procedure where a member of the court has become confirming authority, see
AR 74.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 566:
3.
The proceedings of court-martial, when dispatched by post, should invariably be
sent under registered cover.
Defending Officer, Friend of Accused and Counsel

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 567:
95.
Defending Officer and friend of accused.
(1)
At any general or district court-martial, an accused person may be represented by
any officer subject to the Act who shall be called “the defending officer” or assisted by any
person whose services he may be able to procure and who shall be called “the friend of the
accused”.
(2)
It shall be the duty of the convening officer to ascertain whether an accused person
desires to have a defending officer assigned to represent him at his trial and, if he does so
desire, the convening officer shall use his best endeavours to ensure that the accused shall
be so represented by a suitable officer.  If owing to military exigencies, or for any other
reason, there shall in the opinion of the convening officer, be no such officer available for
the purpose, the convening officer shall give a written notice to the presiding officer of the
court-martial, and such notice shall be attached to the proceedings.
(3)
The defending officer shall have the same right and duties as ascertain to counsel
under these rules and shall be under the like obligations.
(4)
The friend of the accused may advise the accused on all points and suggest the
questions to be put to the witnesses, but he shall not examine or cross-examine the
witnesses or address the court.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 568:
1.
Under AR 33 the accused, after he has been ordered to be tried by court-martial is
to be allowed free communication with his “friend”, defending officer, or legal adviser.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 569:
2.
As to the duties of the defending officer, see memoranda on page…………..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 570:
3.
Every effort should be made to secure the services of a competent officer as a
defending officer, and he should be allowed time and opportunity for properly preparing the
defence of the accused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 571:
4.
AR 36 empowers dispening with sub-rule (2) in the event of military exigencies, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 572:
5.
The defending officer must conduct the case as representing the accused, see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 573:
97(3), 99 and 100.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 574:
96.
Counsel allowed in general and district courts-martial.   In every general and district court-
martial, counsel shall be allowed to appear on behalf of the prosecutor as well as the accused;
provided the convening officer may declare that it is not expedient to allow the appearance of
counsel thereat and such declaration may be made as regards all general and district courts-martial
held in any particular place , or as regards any particular general or district court-martial, and may be
made subject to such reservation as to cases on active service, or otherwise, as deemed expedient.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 575:
1.
For qualifications of counsel, see AR 101 (2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 576:
2.
There is no restriction as to the number of counsels engaged in a case.  Counsel for
the defence, though not bound to such strict impartially as the prosecutor, must
nevertheless recollect that he is assisting in the administration of justice and must not be
guilty of any unfairness or want of candour in his conduct of the case.  In his address he will
have the same liberty as the accused (see AR 77(3); but he should exercise more restraint in
commenting on the acts of persons not before the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 577:
97.
Requirements for appearance of counsel.
(1)
An accused person intending to be represented by a counsel shall give to his
commanding officer or to the convening officer the earliest practicable notice of such
intention and, if no sufficient notice has been given, the court may, if it thinks fit, on the
application of the prosecutor, adjourn to enable him to obtain a counsel on behalf of the
prosecutor at the trial.
(2)
If the convening officer so directs, counsel may appear on behalf of the prosecutor,
but in that case, unless the notice referred to in sub-rule (1)  has been given by the accused,
notice of the direction for counsel to appear shall be given to the accused at such time (not
in any case less than seven days) before the trial, as would, in the opinion of the court, have
enabled the accused to obtain counsel to assist him at the trial.
(3)
The counsel, who appears before a court-martial on behalf of the prosecutor or
accused, shall have the same right as the prosecutor or accused for whom he appears, to
call, and orally examine, cross-examine, and re-examine witnesses, to make an objection or
statement, to address the court, to put in any plea, and to inspect the proceedings, and shall
have the right otherwise to act in the course of the trial in the place of the person on whose
behalf he appears, and he shall comply with these rules as if he were that person and in such
case that person shall not have the right himself to do any of the aforesaid matters except as
regards the statement allowed by clause (a)  of sub-rule (2) of rule 58 and clause (b) of rule

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 578:
59 or except so far as the court permits him so to do.
(4)
When counsel appears on behalf of the prosecutor, the prosecutor, if called as a
witness, may be examined and re-examined as any other witness and sub-rule (5) and (6) of
rule 56 shall not apply.
NOTE
When the convening officer intends to appoint or apply for the services of an officer
of the JAG’s Department or an officer holding legal qualifications to act as prosecutor, similar
notice should be given to the accused to enable him, if he so desires, to obtain counsel to
represent him at the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 579:
98.
Counsel for prosecution.  The counsel appearing on behalf of the prosecutor shall have the
same duty as the prosecutor, and is subject to be stopped or restrained by the court in the manner
provided in sub-rule (2) of rule 77.
NOTE
Counsel appearing on behalf of the prosecutor should always make an opening
address, and should state therein the substance of the charge against the accused and the
nature and general effect of the evidence which he proposes to adduce in support of it
without entering into unnecessary details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 580:
99.
Counsel for accused.   The counsel appearing on behalf of the accused has the like rights,
and is under the like obligations as are specified in sub-rule (3) of rule 77 in the case of the accused.
NOTE
If the court asks counsel for the accused a question as to any witness or matter, he
may decline to answer, but he must not give to the court any answer or information which is
misleading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 581:
100.
General rules as to counsel.   Counsel, whether appearing on behalf of the prosecutor or of
the accused, shall conform strictly to these rules and to the rules of criminal courts in India relating
to the examination, cross-examination, and re-examination of witnesses, and relating to the duties
of a counsel.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 582:
1.
Counsel should not state as a fact any matter which is not proved, or which he does
not intend to prove in evidence, nor should he state what is his own opinion as to any
matter of fact before the court.  In a question to a witness he should not assume that facts
have been given in evidence which have not been so given, or that particular answers have
been given contrary to the fact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 583:
2.
Counsel should treat the court and JA with due respect, and should, while regarding
the exigencies of his case, bear in mind the requirements of military discipline in the
respectful treatment of any superior officer of the accused who may attend as a witness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 584:
101.
Qualification of counsel.
(1)
Neither the prosecutor not the accused has any right to object to any counsel if
properly qualified.
(2)
Counsel shall be deemed properly qualified if he is a legal practitioner authorised to
practise with right of audience in a Court of Sessions in India, or if, he is recognised by the
convening officer in any other country where the trial is held as having in that part, rights
and duties similar to those of such legal practitioner in India and as being subject to
punishment or disability for a breach of professional rules.
Judge-Advocate

Chunk 585:
102.
Disqualification of judge-advocate.  An officer who is disqualified for sitting on a court-
martial, shall be disqualified for acting as a judge-advocate at the court-martial.
NOTES

Chunk 595:
105.
Powers and duties of judge-advocate.   The powers and duties of a judge-advocate are as
follows:-
(1)
The prosecutor and the accused respectively, are, at all times after the judge-
advocate is named to act on the court, entitled to his opinion on any question of law relative
to the charge or trial, whether he is in or out of court, subject, when he is in court, to the
permission of the court.
(2)
At a court-martial, he represents the Judge-Advocate General.
(3)
He is responsible for informing the court of any informality or irregularity in the
proceedings.  Whether consulted or not, he shall inform the convening officer and the court
of any informality or defect in the charge, or in the constitution of the court, and shall give
his advice on any matter before the court.
(4)
Any information or advice given to the court, on any matter before the court shall, if
he or the court desires, it be entered in the proceedings.
(5)
At the conclusion of the case, he shall sum up the evidence and give his opinion
upon the legal bearing of the case, before the court proceeds to deliberate upon its finding.
(6)
The court, in following the opinion of the judge-advocate on a legal point, may
record that it has decided in consequence of that opinion.
(7)
The judge-advocate has, equally with the presiding officer, the duty of taking care
that the accused does not suffer any disadvantages in consequence of his position as such,
or of his ignorance or incapacity to examine or cross-examine witnesses or otherwise, and
may, for that purpose, with the permission of the court, call witnesses and put questions to
witnesses, which appear to him necessary or desirable to elicit the truth.
(7)
In fulfilling his duties, the judge advocate must be careful to maintain an entirely
impartial position.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 596:
1.
For the documents to be forwarded to JA by the convening officer see AR 37(4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 597:
2.
As to summing up, see AR 60 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 598:
3.
Upon any point of law or procedure which arises at the trial, the court should be
guided by the opinion of the JA, and not disregard it, except for very weighty reasons.  The
court is responsible for the legality of its decision, but it must consider the grave
consequences which may result from its disregard to the advice of the JA on any legal point.
If a court-martial,  acting without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, convicts a person
subject to AA, the members of the court may be held liable in damages by a civil court and
such liability – or atleast the amount of the damages – may depend upon the question
whether they exercised a bona fide judgement, and the fact that they accepted the advice of
the JA, even if such advice was held to be wrong, might practically exonerate the members
from liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 599:
4.
For the duty of presiding officer, see AR 76(2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 600:
5.
Permission to call and question witnesses should never be refused unless the court
considers that the JA is acting improperly or in such a manner as to obstruct the
proceedings.  The court should record its reason for refusing permission.

recorded, in the Hindi or English language, the transactions of every summary court-martial.
(2)
The evidence shall be taken down in a narrative form in as nearly as possible the
words used; but in any case where the court considers it material, the question and answer
shall be taken down verbatim.
NOTE

or the accused does not understand, that evidence shall interpreted to the court or officers or junior
commissioned officers attending the proceedings in accordance with sub-section (2) of section 116
or the accused as the case may be in a language which it or he does understand.  The court shall, for
this purpose, either appoint an interpreter, or shall itself take the oath or affirmation prescribed for
an interpreter at a summary court-martial.  When  documents are put in for the purpose of formal
proof, it shall be in the discretion of the court to cause as much to be interpreted as appears
necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 605:
3.
The CO should, as a general rule, take the interpreter’s oath or affirmation himself,
in addition to the oath or affirmation prescribed in AR109 for the court.  In the rare cases
where the CO does not know the language of the accused he should appoint a competent
interpreter.  Whoever interprets any evidence must be sworn or affirmed as an interpreter
before his doing so; but see AR 149.

(1)
A summary court-martial may be sworn or affirmed at one time to try any number
of accused persons then present before it whether those persons are to be tried collectively
or separately.
(2)
In the case of several accused persons to be tried separately, the court, when sworn
or affirmed, shall proceed with one case postponing the other cases and taking them
afterwards in succession.
(3)
Where several accused persons are tried separately upon charges arising out of the
same transaction, the court may, if it considers it to be desirable in the interests of justice,
postpone consideration of any sentence to be awarded to any one or more such accused
persons until the trails of all such accused persons have been completed.

As to framing charges, see ARs 28 to 32 and notes thereto.  Where under AA.s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 613:
120(2), the sanction of the superior authority is necessary for the trial of a charge by SCM,
such sanction should be entered at the foot of the charge-sheet and signed by the superior
authority or a staff officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 614:
2.
“Arraignment” consists of (a) calling upon the accused by his number, rank, name
and description as given in the charge-sheet and asking him “Is that your number, rank,
name and unit (or description)?” (b) reading the charge to him; and (c) asking him whether
he is guilty or not guilty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 615:
3.
Where two or more persons are jointly charged and tried for the same offence, each
is separately arraigned.  Where there are more charge-sheets than one against an accused,
he must be arraigned and tried upon the first charge-sheet before arraignment upon the
second or subsequent charge-sheets; ARs 79 and 126.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 616:
4.
The charge-sheet, after being read to the accused, will be annexed to the
proceedings.

Chunk 617:
5.
The plea of the accused must be taken on all the charges in a charge-sheet.  This
applies to alternative charges if the accused has been arraigned upon them (see however,
AR 115(3).  The plea on each charge should be recorded as “guilty” or “not guilty”.

Amendment of charge.
(1)
At any time during the trial if it appears to the court that there is any mistake in the
name or description of the accused in the charge-sheet, it may amend the charge-sheet so
as to correct that mistake.
(2)
If on the trial of any charge it appears to the court at any time before it has begun to
examine the witnesses, that in the interests of justice any addition to, omission from, or
alteration in, the charge is required, it may amend such charge and may, after due notice to
the accused, and with the sanction of the officer empowered to convene a district court-
martial or on active service a summary general court-martial for the trial of the accused if
the amended charge requires such sanction, proceed with the trial on such amended charge.

Chunk 624:
2.
See AA.s. 120(2) and notes thereto.  If the amended charge is one requiring
reference to superior authority and the officer holding the trial considers that there is grave
reason for immediate action and that such reference cannot be made without detriment to
discipline, he should attach an explanatory memorandum (AR 130) to the proceedings and
after giving the accused sufficient notice of the amendments, proceed with the trial.

Chunk 625:
114.
Special pleas.  If a special plea to the general jurisdiction of the court, or a plea in bar of trial,
is offered by the accused, the procedure laid down for general and district courts-martial when
disposing of such pleas shall, so far as may be applicable, be followed, but no finding by a summary
court-martial on either of such pleas shall require confirmation.
NOTE
See AR 51 and 53 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 626:
115.
General plea of “Guilty” or “Not guilty”.
(1)
“Guilty” or “Not guilty” (or if he refuses to plead, or does not plead intelligibly either
one or the other, a plea of “Not guilty) shall be recorded on each charge.
(2).
If an accused person pleads “Guilty”, that plea shall be recorded as the finding of the
court; but before it is recorded, the court shall ascertain that the accused understands the
nature of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty and shall inform him of the general
effect of that plea, and in particular of the meaning of the charge to which he has pleaded
guilty, and of the difference in procedure which will be made by the plea of guilty, and shall
advice him to withdraw that plea if it appears from the summary of evidence (if any) or
otherwise that the accused ought to plead not guilty.
(2A)
Where an accused pleads Guilty, such plea and the factum of compliance of sub-rule
(2) of this rule, shall be recorded by the court in the following manner:-
Before recording the plea of Guilty of the accused, the court explained to
the accused the meaning of the charge(s) to which he had pleaded Guilty and
ascertained that the accused had understood the nature of the charge(s) to which
he had pleaded Guilty.  The court also informed the accused the general effect of
the plea and the difference in procedure, which will be followed consequent to the
said plea.  The court having satisfied itself that the accused understands the
charge(s) and the effect of his plea of Guilty, accepts and records the same.  The
provisions of rule 115 (2) are thus complied with.
(3)
Where an accused person pleads guilty to the first of two or more charges laid in the
alternative, the court may, after sub-rule (2) of this rule has been complied with and before
the accused is arraigned on the alternative charge or charges, withdraw such alternative
charge or charges without requiring the accused to plead thereto, and a record to that effect
shall be made upon the proceedings of the court.
NOTE
See notes to AR 52 which apply mutatis mutandis to this rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 627:
116.
Procedure after plea of “Guilty”
(1)
Upon the record of the plea of “Guilty”, if there are other charges in the same
charge-sheet to which the plea is “Not guilty”, the trial shall first proceed with respect to the
latter charges, and, after the finding of those charges, shall proceed with the charges on
which a plea of “Guilty” has been entered; but if they are alternative charges, the court may
either proceed with respect to all the charges as if the accused had not pleaded “Guilty” to
any charge, or may, instead of trying him, record a finding upon any one of the alternative
charges to which he has pleaded “Guilty” and a finding or “Not guilty” upon all the other
alternative charges.
(2)
After the record of the plea of “Guilty” on a charge (if the trial does not proceed on
any other charges), the court shall read the summary of evidence, and annex it to the
proceedings or if there is no such summary, shall take and record sufficient evidence to
enable it to determine the sentence, and the reviewing officer to know all the circumstances
connected with the offence.  The evidence shall be taken in like manner as is directed by
these rules in case of a plea of “Not guilty”.
(3)
After such evidence has been taken, or the summary of evidence has been read, as
the case may be, the accused may address the court in reference to the charge and in
mitigation of punishment and may call witnesses as to his character.
(4)
If from the statement of the accused, or from the summary of evidence, or
otherwise, it appears to the court that the accused did not understand the effect of his plea
of “Guilty”, the court shall after the record and enter a plea of “Not guilty”, and proceed
with the trial accordingly.
(5)
If a plea of “Guilty” is recorded and the trial proceeds with respect to other charges
in the same charge-sheet, the proceedings under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall take place when
the findings on the other charges in the same charge-sheet are recorded.
(6)
When the accused states anything in mitigation of punishment which in the opinion
of the court requires to be proved, and would, if proved, affect the amount of punishment,
the court may permit the accused to call witnesses to prove the same.
(7)
In any case where the court is empowered by section 139 to find the accused guilty
of an offence other that that charged, or guilty of committing an offence in circumstances
involving a less degree of punishment, or where it could, after hearing the evidence, have
made a special finding of guilty subject to exceptions or variations in accordance with sub-
rule (3) of rule 121, it may if it is satisfied of the justice of such course, accept and record a
plea of guilty of such other offence, or of the offence as having been committed in
circumstances involving such less degree of punishment, or of the offence charged subject
to such exceptions or variations.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 628:
1.
See notes to AR 54.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 629:
2.
Sub-rule (7) provides for acceptance by the court of a qualified plea of guilty; see
note 9 to AR 62.  The court may accept the qualified plea of guilty, if it is satisfied of the
justice of such a course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 630:
117.
Withdrawal of plea of “Not guilty”.   The accused may, if he thinks fit, at any time during the
trial, withdraw his plea of “Not guilty” and plead “Guilty”, and in such case the court shall at once,
subject to a compliance with sub-rule (2) of rule 115, record a plea and finding of “Guilty”, and shall,
so far as may be, proceed in the manner provided in rule 116.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 631:
118.
Procedure after plea of “Not guilty”.   After the plea of “Not guilty” to any charge is
recorded, the evidence for the prosecution shall be taken.  At the close of the evidence for the
prosecution, the accused shall be asked if he has anything to say in his defence, and may address the
court in his defence, or may defer such address until he has called his witnesses.  The court may
question the accused on the case for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstances
appearing in his statement or in the evidence against him.  The accused shall not render himself
liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, or by giving answers to them which he
knows not to be true; but no oath shall be administered to the accused.
The accused may then call his witnesses, including also witnesses to character.

Chunk 633:
2.
As to the record in the proceedings of transactions of the court, see generally AR 92.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 634:
3.
The evidence will be taken by question and answer, or the witness may be asked to
tell his own story, questions being subsequently asked to make good any omissions. It  will,
as a rule, be recorded in a narrative form; but where the accused or the court considers it
material, the question and answer will be taken down verbatim.  The material effect only of
the question and answer will be written down, e.g., where the question is “what did the
accused do next?” and the answer is “he left the room”, the evidence as recorded would
read “the accused then left the room”.  Documentary evidence after being read should be
marked with a distinguishing letter or figure and attached to the proceedings; see also not 3
to AR 67.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 635:
4.
It is open to the accused, at the close of the case for the prosecution, to submit that
the evidence given for the prosecution has not established a prima facie case against him
and that he should not, therefore be called upon his defence.  If the court is satisfied that it
is well founded, the accused must be acquitted; see AR 57 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 636:
5.
The utmost liberty consistent with the interests of parties not before the court and
with the dignity of the itself should be allowed to the accused in making his defence (see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 637:
77 (3)) and the court should, if necessary, adjourn to allow him time for its preparation.  He
has the privilege of making statement which are unsupported by evidence (see not 10 to AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 638:
58).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 639:
6.
It should be remembered that an accused cannot give evidence on oath and
therefore any statement made by him must be carefully considered.  Though not given on
oath and subject to the test of cross-examination, it will often be of value, particularly if it is
in any respect corroborated by evidence from other sources.

7.
As to questioning of accused by court, see note 3 to AR 58.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 641:

Witnesses in reply to defence.  The court may, if it thinks it necessary in the interest of
justice, call witnesses, in reply to the defence.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 642:
1.
This is an extreme measure and should only be resorted to when the accused has
made or elicited from his witnesses some statement material to the defence, which could
not reasonably have been foreseen when the case for the prosecution was being
investigated ; see also note to AR 143.

Verdict.   After all the evidence, both for prosecution and defence, has been heard, the court
shall give its opinion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the charges.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 645:
1.
The court need not be closed and the finding may be pronounced at once.  On the
other hand the officer holding the trial may clear the court to consider the evidence, or to

2.
See also notes to AR 61 which apply mutatis mutandis to this rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 647:
121.
Form and record of finding.
(1)
The finding on every charge upon which the accused is arraigned shall be recorded,
and except as mentioned in these rules, such finding shall be recorded simply as a finding of
“Guilty”, or of “Not Guilty”.
(2)
When the court is of opinion as regards any charge that the facts proved do not
disclose the offence charged or any offence of which he might under the Act legally be found
guilty on the charge as laid, the court shall acquit the accused of that charge.
(3)
When the court is of opinion as regards any charge that the facts found to be proved
in evidence differ materially from the facts alleged in the statement of particulars in the
charge, but are nevertheless sufficient to prove the offence stated in the charge, and that
the difference is not so material as to have prejudiced the accused in his defence, it may,
instead of a finding of “Not guilty” record a special finding.
(4)
The special finding may find the accused guilty on a charge subject to the statement
of exceptions or variations specified therein.
(5)
The court shall not find the accused guilty on more than one of two or more charges
laid down in the alternative, even if conviction upon one charge necessarily connotes guilty
upon the alternative charge or charges.
NOTE
See notes to AR 62.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 648:
122.
Procedure on acquittal.   If the finding on each of the charges in a charge-sheet is “Not
guilty”, the court shall date and sign the proceedings, the finding shall be announced in open court,
and the accused will be released in respect of those charges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 649:
123.
Procedure on conviction.
(1)
If the finding on any charge is “Guilty”, the court may record of its own knowledge,
or take evidence of and record, the general character, age, service, rank, and any recognised
acts of gallantry or distinguished conduct of the accused, and previous convictions of the
accused either by a court-martial, or a criminal court, any previous punishments awarded to
him by an officer exercising authority under section 80, the length of time he has been in
arrest or in confinement on any previous sentence, and any military decoration, or military
reward, of which he may be in possession or to which he is entitled.
(2)
If the court does not record the matters mentioned in this rule of its own
knowledge, evidence on these matters may be taken in the manner provided in rule 64 for
similar evidence at general and district court-martial.
NOTE
See notes to AR 64.

See notes to AR 65.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 652:
2.
Sentences, unless for one year exactly, should, if for one month or upwards be
recorded in months.  Sentences consisting partly of months and partly of days should be
recorded in months and days.  A month means a calendar month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 653:
3.
When a SCM awards a sentence of imprisonment f a period not exceeding three
months, to which no sentence of dismissal is added, the court should enter a direction,
which should form part of the sentence, that the imprisonment will be carried out by
confinement in military custody (AA.s. 169(3)).  Unless such a direction is given, the offender
has to be committed to a civil prison, which is most undesirable in the case of a person who
is to return to duty after undergoing his punishment.  On active service, however, the officer
commanding the forces in the field can, under, AA.s. 169 (4), appoint places in which
sentence of imprisonment of any length may be carried out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 654:
4.
For the date of sentence of dismissal awarded by a court-martial takes effect, see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 655:
168.  Sentences of imprisonment combined with dismissal should, as a rule, be carried out
by confinement in a civil prison.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 656:
5.
Sentences of simple imprisonment are inexpedient and inconvenient of execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 657:

As to suspension of sentences of imprisonment, see AA.s. 182 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 658:
125.
Signing of proceedings.  The court shall date and sign the sentence and such signature shall
authenticate the whole of the proceedings.
NOTE
It is essential that the date of sentence should be inserted, as under AA.s. 167 a term
of imprisonment is reckoned to commence on the day on which the sentence and
proceedings were signed by the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 659:
126.
Charges in different charge-sheet.   When the charges at a trial by summary court-martial
are contained in different charge-sheets, the procedure laid down for general and district courts-
martial when trying charges contained in different charge-sheets shall, so far as may be applicable,
be followed.
NOTE
As to insertion of charges in separate charge-sheets and procedure, see AR 79 and
notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 660:
127.
Clearing the court.
(1)
The officer holding the trial may clear the court to consider the evidence or to
consult with the officers or junior commissioned officers, attending the trial.
(2)
Except as above-mentioned, all the proceedings, including the view of any place,
shall be in open court, and in presence of the accused.
NOTE
See notes to AR 80.  Apart from the officer holding the trial and the accused, the
officers or JCOs attending the trial must also be present at the “view”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 661:
128.
Adjournment.    A summary court-martial may adjourn from time to time and from place to
place, and may, when necessary, view and place.
NOTE
See generally notes to ARs 81 and 82.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 662:
129.
Friend of the accused.   In any summary court-martial, an accused person may have a
person  to assist him during the trial, whether a legal adviser or any other person.  A person so
assisting him may advise him on all points and suggest the questions to be put to witnesses, but shall
not examine or cross-examine witnesses or address the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 663:
130.
Memorandum to be attached to proceedings.   An explanatory memorandum is to be
attached to the proceedings when a summary court-martial tries, without reference, an offence
which should not ordinarily be so tried.
NOTE
See AA.s. 120(2) and notes.  This explanation should invariably be attached.  If the
officer holding the trial loses sight of the law and tries without reference any of the offences
mentioned in AA.s. 120(2)  without considering whether grave reasons for immediate action
exist or not, the trial is illegal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 664:
131.
Promulgation.   The sentence of a summary court-martial shall(except as provided in rule

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 665:
132) be promulgated, in the manner usual in the service, at the earliest opportunity after it has been
pronounced and shall be carried out without delay after promulgation.
NOTE
See generally notes to AR 71.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 666:
132.
Promulgation to be deferred in certain circumstances.   When the officer holding the trial
has less that five years’ service, the sentence of a summary court-martial shall not (except on active
service) be carried out until approved by superior authority as provided in sub-section (2) of section

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 667:
161.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 668:
1.
The officer to whom the sentence is referred cannot in any way alter the finding or
remit, mitigate, or commute the sentence, but if he considers the sentence too severe he
should inform the officer holding the trial of his views and direct him to modify the
sentence, which order should be obeyed as a matter of discipline.  The original sentence
must not be carried out until the case is finally settled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 669:
2.
The provisions of this rule do not affect the date from which the sentence takes
effect; see AA.s. 167 and AR 168.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 670:
133.
Review of proceedings.   The proceedings of a summary court-martial shall, immediately on
promulgation, be forwarded (through the Deputy Judge-Advocate General of the command in which
the trial is held) to the officer authorised to deal with them in pursuance of section 162.  After
review by him, they will be returned to the accused person’s corps for preservation in accordance
with sub-rule (2) of rule 146.
NOTE
See AA.s. 162.  The proceedings of a SCM will not be set aside on merely technical
grounds.  The words “merits of the case” refer to cases where the charge discloses no
offence, or where the evidence is insufficient to support the charge, or where there is some
material irregularity in procedure which, in the opinion of the reviewing authority has led to
injustice.  But where the accused is not misled by any defect in the charge and the statement
of offence and the particulars taken together disclose an offence under the AA and supply
the accused with sufficient information of the particulars of the charge, which he has to
meet, the evidence on which the accused is convicted is given on oath or affirmation and is
legally admissible and reasonably sufficient to support the charge, and the accused has not
been prejudiced by any irregularity in procedure and has been allowed to call his witnesses
and to cross-examine the witnesses against him, the proceedings may legally be upheld, the
irregularities calling for no more that a remark for future guidance.
SECTION 4 – GENERAL PROVISIONS
Witnesses and evidence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 671:
134.
Calling of all prosecutor’s witnesses.   The prosecutor or, in the case, of a trial by summary
court-martial, the court is not bound to call all the witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence is
in the summary of evidence or whom the accused has been informed he or it intends to call, but he
or it should ordinarily call such of them as the accused desires, in order that he mat cross-examine
them, and shall, for this reason, so far as practicable, secure the attendance of all such witnesses.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 672:
1.
As to giving to the accused the summary or abstract of evidence, see AR 33(7).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 673:
2.
It will be noted that the prosecutor is not required to call any witness at the trial
who was called  by the accused at the taking of summary of evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 674:
3.
It is not necessary for the prosecutor to examine at length a witness for the
prosecution called at the request of the accused and tendered for cross-examination under
this rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 675:
135.
Calling of witness whose evidence is not contained in summary.   If prosecutor, or in the
case of a summary court-martial, the court intends to call a witness whose evidence is not contained
in any summary of evidence given to the accused, notice of the intention shall be given to the
accused a reasonable time before the witness is called together with an abstract of his proposed
evidence; and if such witness is called without such notice having been given the court shall, if the
accused so desires it, either  adjourn after taking the evidence of the witness, or allow the cross-
examination of such witness to be postponed and the court shall inform the accused of his right to
demand such adjournment or postponement.
NOTE
It will be noted that this rule applies only in the case of witnesses called for the
prosecution and not in the case of witnesses called by the accused or by the court under AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 676:
143(4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 677:
136.
List of witnesses of accused.   The accused shall not be required to give the prosecutor or
court a list of the witnesses whom he intends to call but it shall rest with the accused alone to secure
the attendance of any witness whose evidence is not contained in the summary and for whose
attendance the accused has not requested steps to be taken as provided by sub-rule (1) of rule 34.
NOTE
A member of the court, JA and prosecutor  are competent witnesses for the defence
and may be sworn/affirmed at any stage of the proceedings, but an officer should not be
detailed to serve as a member of, or act as prosecutor or JA at, a court-martial if his
evidence is likely to be required.  A witness for the prosecution cannot serve as a member of
the court or act as JA at the trial of the case in which he is a witness (See AR 39(2)(b) and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 678:
102).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 679:
137.
Procuring attendance of witnesses.
(1)
In the case of trials by general or district court-martial, the commanding officer of
the accused, the convening officer or, after assembly of the court, the presiding officer, shall
take proper steps to procure the attendance of the witnesses whom the prosecutor  or
accused desires to call, and whose attendance can reasonably be procured,  but the person
requiring the attendance of a witness may be required to undertake to defray the cost (if
any) of their attendance.
(2)
The court shall, in the case of trials by summary court-martial, take proper steps to
procure the attendance of the witnesses whom the accused desires to call and whose
attendance can reasonably be procured, but the accused may be required to undertake to
defray the cost (if any) of their attendance.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 680:
1.
See AA.s 135 as to summoning witnesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 681:
2.
Form of summons, see Appendix III, Part III to AR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 682:
3.
Witnesses who are subject to AA should be ordered by the proper authority to
attend without the issue of a formal summons.  The appropriate naval or air force
authorities should be approached for the attendance of witness subject to naval or air force
law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 683:
4.
An accused person can have no technical ground of complaint if the attendance of a
witness from distant parts cannot be procured, but it is the duty of the CO or convening
officer, or after the assembly of the court, the presiding officer, or, in the case of trial by
SCM, the court, to take all reasonable steps to secure the attendance of any witness whom
there is any ground to suppose to be material to the defence, and AR 138 makes provision
for the adjournment of the court if the attendance of such witness is essential.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 684:
5.
The power to require the person calling a witness to undertake to defray the cost of
his attendance is given in order to prevent an unreasonable demand by prosecutors or
accused persons for the attendance of witnesses.  In the case of the prosecutor, the cost will
usually be defrayed as part of the expenses of the prosecution.  In the case of the accused,
this provision should not be allowed to interfere with the calling of a witness who appears to
be material.  The absence of a material witness might afterwards be held to invalidate the
proceedings of a court-martial, even though, if the witness had been called, the court would
probably have arrived at the same decision, inasmuch as it is impossible to tell what effect
the evidence of such a witness might have had upon the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 685:
6.
As to expenses of witnesses, see Travel Regulations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 686:
7.
If a civilian witness had in his possession or under his control any books, accounts,
letters, returns, papers, or other documents which are considered necessary for the trial,
care must be taken in summoning him to require him to bring them with him; the witness
would be justified in declining to acknowledge a mere oral request.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 687:
8.
For action where a civilian witness, who has been duly summoned and whose
expenses have been tendered, makes default in attending, see AR 150(3) and notes thereto.
As to privilege from arrest under civil or revenue process of a witness summoned to attend
before a court-martial, see AA.s. 30.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 688:
138.
Procedure when essential witness is absent.  If such proper steps as mentioned in the
preceding rule have not been taken as to any witness, or if any witness whose attendance could not
be reasonably procured before the assemble of the court is essential to the prosecution or defence,
the court shall:-
(a)
take steps to procure the issue of a commission for the examination of such witness;
or
(b)
if it is a general or district court-martial, adjourn and report the circumstances to the
convening officer; or
(c)
If it is a summary court-martial, adjourn to enable the witness to attend, or adopt
such other course as appears to the officer holding the trial best calculated to do justice.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 689:
1.
See AA.ss. 137 and 138.  Only the JAG of the DJAG of a command can issue a
commission and then only when action is initiated by a court-martial.  An AJAG cannot issue
a commission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 690:
2.
At a SCM the court may, for instance, acquit the accused forthwith, or order his
release without prejudice to his subsequent trial should the witness become available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 691:
139.
Withdrawal of witnesses from court.   During the trial a witness, other than the prosecutor,
shall not, except by special leave of the court, be permitted to be present in court while not under
examination and if, while he is under examination, a discussion arises as to the allowance of a
question, or the sufficiency of his answers, or otherwise as to his evidence, he may be directed to
withdraw.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 692:
1.
It is customary to have all witnesses present in court while the members of the court
are being sworn/affirmed, but they should withdraw before the arraignment.  This does not,
of course, apply to the prosecutor if he is a witness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 693:
2.
Permission to remain in court while not under examination may reasonably be
given, e.g., to expert or professional witnesses, provided that no objection is made by or on
behalf of the accused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 694:
3.
If any such discussion arises as is mentioned in the rule, the court should generally
order the witness to withdraw, as his answer might be influenced by the discussion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 695:
140.
Oath or affirmation to be administered to witnesses.   An oath or affirmation shall, if so
required by the Act, be administered to every witness before he gives his evidence by the judge-
advocate (if any), a member of the court, or some other person empowered by the court in one of
the following forms or in such other form to the same purport as the court ascertains to be
according to the religion or otherwise binding on the conscience of the witness.
Form of Oath
“I …………………………… swear by almighty God that what I shall state shall be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth”
Form of Affirmation
“I …………………………… do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that what I
shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth”
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 696:
1.
For manner of administering and taking oaths and affirmations see notes to ARs 45
and 47.

Chunk 697:
2.
The following is a translation into Hindi of the above oath:-
(Form of Oath)
(Main …………………………. Parmeshwar ki shapath leta hun, kih main jo kuchh kahunga

Chunk 698:
3.
The following is a translation into Hindi of the above affirmations:-
(Form of Affirmation)
(Main …………………………… satya nishtha, shudh hridaya tatha sachhai se ghoshana
karta hun aur partigya karta hun ki main jo kuchh kahunga vah satya, purna satya aur kewal
satya hoga).

As to power of dealing with recalcitrant witnesses, see AA.s. 59 (in the case of
persons subject to AA) and AR 150 (in other cases).  See also AA.s. 152 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 700:
141.
Mode of questioning witness.
(1)
Every question shall be put to a witness orally by the officer holding the trial, by the
prosecutor, by or on behalf of the accused, or by the judge-advocate and the witness will
forthwith reply, unless an objection is made by the court, judge-advocate, prosecutor, or
accused, in which case he shall not reply until the objection is disposed of.  The witness shall
address his reply to the court.
(2)
The evidence of a witness as taken down shall be read to him if he so requests
before he leaves the court, and shall, if necessary, be corrected.  If he makes any explanation
or correction, the prosecutor and accused or counsel or the defending officer may
respectively examine him respecting the same.
(3)
If the witness denies the correctness of any part of the evidence when the same is
read over to him, the court may instead of correcting the evidence, record the objection
made to it by the witness.
(4)
If the evidence is not given in English and the witness does not understand the
language, the evidence as recorded shall be interpreted to him in the language in which it
was given, or in a language which he understands if he so requests before he leaves the
court.
(5)
Where evidence is recorded by shorthand writer, it shall not be necessary to read
the evidence of the witness to him under sub-rule (2) or (4), if, in the opinion of the court
and the judge-advocate, if any (such opinion to be recorded in the proceedings), it is
unnecessary to do so.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 701:
1.
The court and JA must carefully listen to the actual questions put by the prosecutor
and by or on behalf of the accused, as well as to the form in which such questions are put,
and they must intervene before the witness replies if in their opinion, any question is
improper or “leading”.  If either the prosecutor or the accused, or the officer or counsel
representing him, considers that a particular question about to be put by him may be
objected to, he should submit the propriety of the question to the decision of the court,
having first informed the witness that he must not make his reply until the decision of the
court ahs been given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 702:
2.
A witness is first examined by the person calling him, then cross-examined by the
opposite party, after which he may be re-examined by the party calling him on matters
raised in the cross-examination.  The court should, if requested by either party, allow the
cross-examination of a witness by the party to be postponed, especially if his evidence
comes as a surprise; see also AR 135 where a witness is called whose evidence is not
contained in the summary or abstract of evidence.  A request for postponement should not
be acceded to, if, in the opinion of the court, it is made for purposes of obstruction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 703:
3.
When the evidence of a witness has been read to him, he should be asked whether
it is correct.  Any material alteration or explanation should be inserted at the end of the
record of his evidence, and not by way of interlineations or erasure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 704:
4.
If the witness makes any explanation or correction, the prosecutor and accused or
counsel or defending officer may respectively examine him respecting the same.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 705:
5.
Under the sub-rule (2) and (4) evidence of a witness is required to be read over or
translated to him if he so wishes.  The fact that the witness was informed of his right under
the said sub-rules should be recorded in the proceedings, if he declines to have his
statement read over or translated to him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 706:
6.
After a witness has given his evidence every effort should be made to keep him
separate from other witnesses who have not given their evidence before the court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 707:
142.
Questions to witnesses by court or judge-advocate.
(1)
The presiding officer, the judge-advocate (if any), or the officer holding the trial and,
with the permission of the court, any member of the court may address a question to a
witness while such witness is giving his original evidence and before he withdraws.
(2)
Upon any such question being answered, the presiding officer, the judge-advocate
(if any), or the officer holding the trial, shall also put to the witness any question relative to
that answer which he prosecutor or the accused or counsel or the defending officer may
request him to put and which the court deem reasonable.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 708:
1.
It will be noted that this rule applies only to the original evidence of a witness and
not to any evidence given by him on being recalled.  As to recalled witnesses, see AR 143.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 709:
2.
It is desirable that any questions should be put after the conclusion of the
examination, cross-examination (If any) of the witness; but questions may properly be put to
a witness during his examination in order that his evidence may be clearly recorded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 710:
3.
The presiding officer, JA or officer holding the trial should always, under the
provisions of this rule, put any question which they are requested by the prosecutor, or by
or on behalf of the accused, to put and which does not seem unreasonable.  It is to be noted
that members of the court other than the presiding officer are not empowered except in the
circumstances mentioned in sub-rule (1), to put questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 711:
143.
Re-calling of witnesses and calling of witnesses in reply.
(1)
At the request of the prosecutor or of the accused, a witness may, by leave of the
court, be recalled at any time before the closing address of or on behalf of the accused (or at
a summary court-martial at any time before the finding of the court) for the purpose of
having any question put to him through the presiding officer, the judge-advocate (if any), or
the officer holding the trial.
(2)
The court may, if it considers it expedient, in the interest of justice, so to do allow a
witness to be called or recalled by the prosecutor, before the closing address of or on behalf
of the accused, for the purpose of rebutting any material statement made by a witness for
the defence or for the purpose of giving evidence on any new matter which the prosecutor
could not reasonably have foreseen.
(3)
Where the accused has called witnesses to character, the prosecutor before the
closing address of or on behalf of the accused, may call or re-call witnesses for the purpose
of proving a previous conviction or entries in the defaulters’ book against the accused.
(4)
The court may call or re-call any witness at any time before the finding, if it
considers that it is necessary for the ends of justice.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 712:
1.
The presiding officer, JA or officer holding the trial should also put to a witness
recalled under the provisions of sub-rule (1) any further questions which they consider
necessary in view of the answers given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 713:
2.
Sub rules (2) and (3) are inapplicable to a SCM where there is no prosecutor, Sub-
rule (4) will , however, admit of the officer holding the trial calling or recalling witnesses in
similar circumstances when the ends of justice require it.  See also AR 119.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 714:
3.
The power given under sub-rule (4) of calling or recalling a witness should only be
exercised in exceptional circumstances, e.g., where it appears for the first time from the
evidence given at the trial that a person, who has not been called either by the prosecutor or
on behalf of the defence, was present at, and probably witnessed the occurrence which
forms the subject of the charge which is being tried.  Witnesses should not be called or
recalled under this provision in order to supplement any negligent conduct on the part of
the prosecution.  If witnesses are called or recalled under this provision, the prosecutor and
the accused should be invited to put or suggest any relevant questions which in their opinion
should be put by the court.  If new evidence is given after the closing address by or on behalf
of the accused, the court should permit the accused or his representative to make a further
address upon the new matter which has been elicited (if any).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 715:
4.
If a witness is recalled, he should not be sworn or affirmed again, but reminded of
his previous oath or affirmation.  The fact of his being so reminded should be recorded in the
proceedings.
Addresses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 716:
144.
Addresses.   All addresses by the prosecutor and the accused and the summing up of the
judge-advocate may either be given orally or in writing, and if in writing shall be read in open court.
NOTE
The summing-up of the JA should invariably be in writing.  See note 1 to AR 60.  Also
see AR 92(4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 717:
145.
Finding of insanity.
(1)
Where the court finds either that the accused by reason of unsoundness of mind, is
incapable of making his defence; or that he committed the act alleged but was reason of
unsoundness of mind incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that it was wrong or
contrary to law, the court shall give brief reasons in support thereof.  The judge advocate, if
any, or the presiding officer or in the case of summary court-martial, the officer holding the
trial shall record or cause to be recorded such brief reasons in the proceedings.
(2)
The presiding officer or in the case of summary court-martial, the officer holding the
trial, shall date and sign the above record, and the proceedings, upon being signed by the
judge-advocate, if any, shall at once be transmitted to the confirming officer or to the
authority empowered to deal with its finding under section 162, as the case may be.

Preservation of proceedings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 720:
146.
Preservation of proceedings.
(1)
The proceedings of a court-martial (other than a summary court-martial) shall, after
promulgation, be forwarded, as circumstances require, to the office of the Judge-Advocate
General, and there preserved for not less, in the case of a general court-martial, than seven
years, and, in the case of any other court-martial, than three years.
(2)
The proceedings of a summary court-martial shall be preserved for not less than
three years, with the records of the corps or department to which the accused belonged.

Chunk 721:
147.
Right of person tried to copies of proceedings.  Every person tried by a court-martial (other
than Summary Court Martial) shall, after the proceedings have been signed by the Presiding Officer
and in the case of Summary Court-Martial the officer holding the trial, and before they are
destroyed, on a request made by such person in writing to the Court or the officer holding the trial
or the person having the custody of his proceedings, be entitled for the supply of a copy of such
proceedings, within a reasonable time and free of cost, including the proceedings upon revision, if
any.
NOTES
(1)
Under this rule an accused is entitled to a copy of the proceedings of his trial free of
charge.  In case of joint trial by SCM the officer holding the trial or in case of joint trial by
GCM, DCM, or SGCM the convening officer, should ensure that sufficient copies of the
proceedings are prepared to facilitate delivery of the same to the accused on demand.  The
application for a copy of the proceedings should be made personally by the accused.

Chunk 722:
2.
For custody of proceedings after confirmation or where no confirmation is required,
see AR 146.

Chunk 723:
147A. Copy of proceedings not to be given in certain cases.  Notwithstanding anything contained
in rule 147, if the Central Government certifies that it is against the interests of the security of the
State or friendly relations with foreign States to supply a copy of the proceedings or any part thereof
under the said rule, he shall not be furnished with such copy:
Provided that if the Central Government is satisfied that the person demanding the copy is
desirous of submitting a petition in accordance with the Act or instituting any action in a court of law
in relation to the finding or sentence, it shall permit inspection of the proceedings to such person or
his legal adviser, if any, on the following conditions, namely:-
(a)
the inspection shall be made at such times and such places as the Central
Government or any authority authorized by it may direct; and
(b)
the person allowed to inspect the proceedings shall, before such inspection,
furnish:-
(i)
an undertaking, in writing, that he shall not make copies of the proceedings
or any part thereof and that the information or documents contained in such
proceedings shall not be used by him, for any purpose whatsoever other than for
the purpose of submitting a petition in accordance with the Act or instituting an
action in a court of law in relation to the said finding or sentence; and
(ii)
a certificate that he is aware that he may render himself liable to
prosecution under sections 3 and 5 of the Indian Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of

Chunk 725:
148.
Loss of proceedings.
(1)
If, before confirmation, the original proceedings of a court-martial which require
confirmation or any part thereof, are lost, a copy thereof, if any, certified by the presiding
officer of or the judge-advocate at the court-martial may be accepted in lieu of original.
(2)
If there is no such copy, and sufficient evidence of the charge, finding, sentence, and
transactions of the court can be procured, that evidence may, with the assent of the
accused, be accepted in lieu of the original proceedings, or part thereof, which have been
lost.
(3)
In any case above in this rule mentioned, the finding and sentence may be
confirmed, and shall be as valid as if the original proceedings, or part thereof, had not been
lost.
(4)
If the accused refuses the assent referred to in sub-rule (2), he may be tried again,
and the finding and sentence of the previous court of which the proceedings have been lost
shall be void.
(5)
If, after confirmation or in any case where confirmation is not required, the original
proceedings of a court-martial or any part thereof are lost, and there is sufficient evidence of
the charge, finding, sentence, and transactions of the court and of the confirmation (if
required) of the finding and sentence, that evidence shall be a valid and sufficient record of
the trial for all purposes.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 726:
1.
Confirmation is not complete until the finding and sentence have been promulgated,
see AR 71.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 727:
2.
As to annexure to the proceedings of original documents, see note 3 to AR 67.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 728:
3.
The evidence may be obtained by the presiding officer or some member of the court
writing out from memory the substance of the charge, finding, sentence and transactions of
the court, which should be authenticated by the signatures of the members.  A copy of the
charge, however, should always be procured if possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 729:
4.
As soon as it is known that the proceedings have been lost; steps should be taken to
obtain and preserve the best evidence available.
Irregular Procedure when no injustice is done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 730:
149.
Validity of irregular procedure in certain cases.   Whenever, it appears that a court-martial
had jurisdiction to try any person and make a finding and that there is legal evidence or a plea of
guilty to justify such finding, such finding and any sentence which the court-martial had jurisdiction
to pass thereon may be confirmed, and shall, if so confirmed and in the case of a summary court-
martial where confirmation is not necessary, be valid, notwithstanding any deviation from these
rules or notwithstanding that the charge-sheet has not been signed by the commanding officer or
the convening officer, provided that the charges have, in fact, before trial been approved by the
commanding officer and the convening officer or notwithstanding any defect or objection, technical
or other, unless it appears that any injustice has been done to the offender, and where any finding
and sentence are otherwise valid they shall not be invalid by reason only of a failure to administer an
oath or affirmation to the interpreter or shorthand writer; but nothing in this rule shall relieve an
officer from any responsibility for any willful or negligent disregard of any of these rules.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 731:
1.
This rule is intended to prevent a miscarriage of justice in consequence of defects,
usually of a technical nature, in matters of procedure which do not affect the real merits of
the case; but before acting upon this rule the confirming officer must be satisfied that the
accused has not suffered any injustice through any deviation from the AR or through any
defect or objection.  Whether or not a deviation, etc., is of a substantial nature will often
depend upon the circumstances.  The court should not allow any technicality to interfere
with the accused in the making of his defence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 732:
2.
The confirming officer should always direct the attention of all officers concerned to
deviations and defects which have been observed and for which they are responsible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 733:
3.
It may be convenient to note here that if, after confirmation, the charges or findings
thereon are declared to be invalid, the trial must be treated as null, the conviction set aside,
the person convicted relieved of all consequences of his trial and the record of conviction
erased.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 734:
4.
As to the substitution of valid finding and sentence for invalid finding and sentence,
see AA.s. 163.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 735:
5.
As to review of SCsM, see AA.s. 162 and notes to AR 133.
Offences of witnesses and others

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 736:
150.
Offences of witnesses and others.   When any court-martial is of opinion that there is
ground for inquiring into any offence specified in sections 59 and 60 and committed before it or
brought under its notice in the course of its proceedings, or into any act done by a person subject to
the Act, have constituted such an offence, such court-martial may proceed as follows that is to say:-
(1)
If the person who appears to have committed the offence is subject to the Act, the
court may bring his conduct to the notice of the proper military authority, and may also
order him to be placed in military custody with a view to his punishment by an officer
exercising authority under section 80, 83, 84 or 85 to his trial by a court-martial.
(2)
If the person who appears to have done the act is amenable to naval or air force law,
the court may bring his conduct to the notice of the proper naval or air force authority, as
the case may be.
(3)
If the person who appears to have done the act is not subject to military, naval or air
force law, then in the case of acts which would, if done by a person subject to the Act, have
constituted an offence under clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) of section 59, the officer who
summoned the witness to appear or the presiding officer or officer holding the court, as the
case may be, may forward a written complaint to the nearest Magistrate of the first class
having jurisdiction, and in the case of acts which would, if done as aforesaid, l have
constituted an offence under clause (e) of section 59 of section 60, the court, after making
any preliminary inquiry that may be necessary, may send the case to the nearest Magistrate
of the first class having jurisdiction for inquiry or trial in accordance with section 340 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973(Act 2 of 1974).
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 737:
1.
A trial by court-martial is deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of
IPC.ss. 193 and 228.  A court-martial is deemed to be a court within the meaning of CrPC.ss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 738:
480 and 482 (CrPC 1973, ss. 345 and 346); see AA.s. 152 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 739:
2.
An act includes an illegal omission, See AA.s. 3(xxv) and IPC.s. 32.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 740:
3.
When a person subject to AA commits an offence under any of the clauses of AA.s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 741:
59, or when a corresponding offence is committed by a person subject to naval or air force
law or by a civilian, court-martial will often act wisely in accepting an apology sufficient to
vindicate their dignity instead of resorting to the more severe measures here indicated.  As
already pointed out (note 3 to AR 76) the best course to adopt when a person, other than
the accused, interrupts the proceedings will ordinarily be to order his exclusion from the
court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 742:
4.
Courts-martial should exercise the greatest discretion in instituting proceedings or in
taking measures which may result in the institution of proceedings, against a person subject
of AA for the offence specified in AA.s. 60, or against a person subject to naval or air force
law, or a civilian for corresponding offence.  It is not enough that the court-martial has by its
verdict shown that it did not believe the witness, for it may have thought him to be mistaken
or, on the balance of probabilities, it may have accepted another version of what took place.
Before instituting proceedings as indicated in this rule against a witness, the court should be
satisfied that there are good grounds for believing that the witness has willfully given false
evidence on some point which is material to the issue, and that his conviction is likely.  The
credit of another witness is a point material to the issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 743:
5.
When it is likely that a witness will be prosecuted for giving false evidence, the exact
words used, in the language in which the evidence was given, should be recorded; see AR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 744:
92(2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 745:
6.
In the case of a person subject to AA, the court-martial may, in its discretion either
merely report his conduct to the proper military authority, or may in addition order him into
military custody pending disposal of his case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 746:
7.
If a person is so ordered into custody this fact should be mentioned in the report;
and it then becomes the duty of the officer receiving the report to see that the case is
promptly investigated in accordance with AA.s. 102(1).  The report should be in sufficient
detail to place the officer in full possession of the facts and enable him to exercise his
discretion whether to order trial by court-martial if he is competent to do so, or to direct
summary disposal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 747:
8.
As to “proper military authority”, see AR 2 (d).  This will depend on the status of the
offender, and the authority under whose orders the court has been convened.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 748:
9.
In the case of a SCM the officer holding the trial would ordinarily report to the next
superior authority and a GDM, DCM or SGCM would report to the convening officer
observing in each case the usual channel of correspondence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 749:
10.
As explained in the notes to AA.s. 59, the members of a court-martial reporting an
officer under this rule are individually disqualified (AR 39(2)(c) and (e) from trying him on
charges arising out of their report.  If the officer, to whom the case is finally referred,
decides on trial, he must convene a new court for the purpose.  For similar reasons it is
undesirable that a CO should try by SCM a person under his command who has offended
against his authority when holding a SCM or when sitting as a member of a GCM, DCM or
SGCM.  He could, save in grave emergency, only do so with the sanction of superior
authority which should, therefore, as a rule, be withheld – AA.s 120(2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 750:
11.
A court-martial convened or assembled under AA has, as such, no authority over a
person subject to naval or air force law and cannot as a court order him into military
custody.  Sub-rule (2) enables the court merely to report offences of contempt or of giving
false evidence committed by such persons to proper naval or air force authority for disposal
under the appropriate act.  See, however, AA.s. 152 and notes thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 751:
12.
When a person subject to AA commits contempt or gives false evidence before a
court-martial other than the one convened under AA, the charge can only be framed under
AA.s. 63, as a court-martial convened under an Act other than AA is not a court-martial for
the purpose of charges under AA.s. 59 to 60.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 752:
13.
Sub rule (3) deals with civilian offenders; Cr PC.ss. 195 and 476 (Cr PC 1973, ss. 195
and 340/341) provide for the institution of proceedings for certain offences against the IPC,
on the written complaint of the public servant concerned or of the court before which the
offence complained of was committed.  A court-martial is a “criminal court” for the purpose
of the above sections and is also a “court of justice” for the purpose of the IPC.  See Cr PC.s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 753:
6 and IPC.s. 20.  The effect of this is that all the acts and omissions which are punishable
under AA.s. 59 clause (a), (b), (c) or (d), when committed by person subject to AA, are, when
committed by civilians, offences under IPC.ss.174, 175, 178 and 179, for which the officer
who summoned the witness to appear or the officer conducting the proceedings of the
court-martial, as the case may be, can institute proceedings under Cr PC.s. 195(1)(a); and
that all acts and omissions which are punishable under AA.ss. 59(e) and 60 when committed
by persons subject to AA are, when committed by civilians, offences under IPC.ss. 193, 194
and 228, for which the aggrieved court-martial can institute proceedings under Cr PC.s. 476
(Cr PC 1973, s. 340).  Before instituting such proceedings, the officer (in the case of offences
corresponding to those in AA.s. 59, clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d)), and a court-martial (in the case
of offences corresponding to those in AA.s. 59(e) or (60) must prima facie be satisfied that a
definite offence has been committed by some definite person or persons against whom
proceedings in a criminal court are to be taken.  It is not sufficient that the circumstances
may raise some sort of a suspicion against someone.  In such a case the officer or the court-
martial, as the case may be, should either allow the matter to drop, or should make or hold
a preliminary inquiry to see who is to be prosecuted and for what. A court’s decision to
institute proceedings must be a judicial one, i.e., either based on what the court has itself
heard or seen and considered, or on evidence taken before it and considered.  Similarly an
officer’s decision to institute proceedings must be a reasonable one, based on sufficient
grounds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 754:
14.
The report to the magistrate may be in letter form, and should be sufficiently
detailed to place him in full possession of all the materials on which the decision to
prosecute was based.  It should set forth the name and identity of the person accused and of
the witnesses who can substantiate the accusation.  A narrative of the events complained of,
should be included in the report and a record of the evidence taken in preliminary inquiry (if
any) attached.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 755:
15.
In the case of a person subject to naval or air force law the proper course is to report
the offence to the proper naval or air force authority, though proceedings could be taken
under sub-rule (3).
SECTION 5 – SUMMARY GENERAL COURTS-MARTIAL
The foregoing rules in this Chapter shall not, save as hereinafter mentioned, apply to a
summary general court-martial which shall be subject to the following rules, namely-

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 756:
151.
Convening the court and record of proceedings.
(1)
The court may be convened and the proceedings of the court recorded in
accordance with the form in Appendix III, with such variations as the circumstances of each
case may require.
(2)
The officer convening the court shall appoint or detail the officers to from the court,
and may also appoint or detail such officers as waiting members as he thinks expedient.
Such officers should have held commissions for not less than one year, but, if any officers
are available who have held commissions for not less than three years, they should be
selected in preference to officers of less service.
(3)
The provost-martial, an assistant provost martial, or an officer who is prosecutor or
witness for the prosecution shall not be appointed a member of the court, but subject to
sub-rule (2), any other available officer may be appointed to sit.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 757:
1.
In the convening order, members and waiting members (if any) may be appointed
by name, or only their ranks and units may be mentioned.  In the latter event, the ranks,
names, etc., of the members of the court as constituted, will be recorded in the proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 758:
2.
The convening order must be signed personally by the convening officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 759:
3.
Under sub-rule (2), it is no mandatory that a member of a SGM must have held a
commission for not less than one year.  An officer with less than one year’s commissioned
service can legally sit as a member.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 760:
152.
Charge.  The statement of an offence may be made briefly in any language sufficient to
describe or disclose an offence under the Act.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 761:
153.
Trial of several accused persons.   The court may be sworn at the same time to try any
number of accused persons then present before it, but except as provided in rule 35, the trial of
each accused person shall be separate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 762:
154.
Challenges.
(1)
The names of the presiding officer and members of the court shall be read over to
the accused who shall thereupon be asked if he objects to be tried by ary of these officers.
(2)
Any objection shall be decided as provided for in section 130 and rule 44 – the
vacancies being filled from among the waiting members (if any), or by fresh members being
appointed by the convening officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 763:
155.
Swearing or affirming the court, judge-advocate, etc.  The provisions of rule 45, 46 and 47
relating to administering and taking of oaths and making of affirmations shall apply to every
summary general court-martial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 764:
156.
Arraignment.   When the court is sworn or affirmed, the judge-advocate (if any) or the
presiding officer shall state to the accused then to be tried, the offence with which he is charged
with, if necessary, an explanation giving him full information of the act or omission with which he is
charged and shall ask the accused whether he is guilty or not guilty of the offence.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 765:
1.
As to objection by accused to charge, see AR 49 which by AR 164 is applied, so far as
practicable, to a SGCM.  As to responsibility of presiding officer, see AR76.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 766:
2.
As to general plea of “Guilty” or “Not Guilty”, see AR 52 and notes; as to procedure
after plea of “Guilty”, see AR 54.  Both these rules are, by AR 164 applied, so far as
practicable, to a SGCM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 767:
3.
A plea of “Guilty” will not be accepted by the court if the charge or charges upon
which an accused is arraigned render him liable, on conviction, to be sentenced to death.  If
such plea is offered, the court will enter a plea of “Not Guilty” and proceed with the trial
accordingly.  See AR 52 (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 768:
157.
Plea of jurisdiction.  If a special plea to the general jurisdiction is offered by the accused, and
is considered by the court to be proved, the court shall report the same to the convening officer.
NOTE
See AR 51, which by AR 164 is applied, so far as practicable, to a SGCM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 769:
158.
Evidence.
(1)
The witnesses for the prosecution will be called and the accused shall be allowed to
cross- examine them and to call any available witnesses for his defence.
(2)
An oath or affirmation as laid down in rule 140 shall be administered to every
witness, if so required by the Act, before he gives his evidence, by one of the persons
specified in the rule.
NOTE
Although by AR 164 only a limited number of the foregoing rules are applied to
SGCM, so far as practicable, the procedure to be adopted at a SGCM should be the same as
at a GCM or DCM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 770:
159.
Defence.
(1)
The accused shall be asked what he has to say in his defence, and shall be allowed to
make his defence.  He may be allowed to have any person to assist him during the trial.
(2)
The court or  the judge-advocate, if any, may question the accused on the case for
the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstances appearing in his statement or in
the evidence against him.  The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by
refusing to answer such questions, or by giving answers to them which he knows not be
true.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 771:
1.
See note to AR 158.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 772:
2.
As to rights of the accused to prepare his defence, see AR 33 which by AR 164 is
applied, so far as practicable, to a SGCM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 773:
3.
See ARs 95 to 101.  If the person assisting is an officer subject to AA or a counsel (see
AR 10(2)), he may be allowed full privileges of address, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 774:
160.
Record of the Evidence and defence.
(1)
The judge-advocate (if any), or the presiding officer shall take down or cause to
betaken down a brief record of the evidence of the witnesses at the trial and of the defence
of the accused; the record so taken down shall be attached to the proceedings.
(2)
If it appears to the convening officer that military exigencies or other circumstances
prevent compliance with sub-rule (1), he may direct that the trial will be carried on without
any such brief record being taken down.
(3)
If the accused pleads “Guilty” the summary or abstract of evidence, if any, may be
read and attached to the proceedings, and it shall not be necessary for the court to hear
witnesses for the prosecution, respecting matters contained in the summary or abstract of
evidence so read.
NOTE
It would hardly ever be necessary for the convening officer to give such a direction
as is mentioned in sub-rule (2). If he does so, he must record it in his order convening the
court and state shortly the exigencies or other circumstances which appear to him to
prevent compliance with this rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 775:
161.
Finding and sentence.   The court shall then be closed to consider its finding.  If the finding
on any charge is “Guilty”, the court may receive any evidence as to previous convictions and
character which is available.  The court shall then deliberate in closed court as to its sentence.

162.
Signing and transmission of proceedings.   Upon the court arriving at a finding of “Not
Guilty”, or awarding the sentence in case of having at a finding of “Guilty”, the presiding officer shall
date and sign the finding or sentence, as the case may be.  The signature shall authenticate the
whole of the proceedings and the proceedings upon being signed by the judge-advocate, if any, shall
at once be transmitted to the confirming officer, for confirmation.

Chunk 789:
168.
Sentence of Cashiering or Dismissal.
(1)
A sentence of cashiering or dismissal awarded by a court-martial shall take effect

except in the case of an officer, from such subsequent date as may be specified by the
commanding officer at the time of such promulgation.
(2)
When dismissal is combined with imprisonment which is to be carried out in a
military prison or in military custody or with field punishment, the dismissal shall not take
effect until the date on which the prisoner is released from a military prison or from military-
custody, or until the completion of the field punishment, unless such field punishment is
remitted by a competent authority.
(3)
When cashiering or dismissal is combined with imprisonment for life or with
imprisonment which is to be carried out in a civil prison, the cashiering or dismissal shall not
take effect until the date on which the prisoner is received into a civil prison.
NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 790:
1.
Under AA.s. 23, a discharge certificate must be furnished to every JCO, WO or
enrolled person who is dismissed from the service (see also AR 12).  An officer is not
furnished with a discharge certificate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 791:
2.
A sentence of cashiering or dismissal awarded a court-martial to an officer takes
effect from the date of promulgation, or when combined with imprisonment, from the date
on which the prisoner is received into a civil prison.  The sentence is notified in the gazette
of India.

Chunk 792:
3.
It may sometimes be expedient for a CO, in order to keep a person sentenced to
dismissal (other than an officer) subject to AA for a short period, to specify a date
subsequent to the date of promulgation.  If he considers such action desirable he must do so
at the time of the promulgation of the sentence to the person and he should record the date
he specified in the minute of promulgation.  When a CO exercises this option of specifying a
subsequent date, the date specified must be strictly limited by the requirement of the case.
For instance, in the case of a person sentenced out of India to dismissal alone, or to dismissal
combined with imprisonment which is carried out locally either in military custody or for
special reasons in local civil custody (AA.s. 171), the subsequent date might be “date of
disembarkation” of “date of embarkation” according to whether the intention is to despatch
the person to India on a transport or by a private vessel.  It is obviously desirable to keep the
person subject to military discipline while traveling on a transport or until he can be
despatched to India.  If the person is to be sent by a transport, the CO can enter in the
discharge certificate “date of disembarkation” as the date from which the dismissal takes
effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 793:
4.
The effect of sub-rule (3) is that a prisoner under sentence of cashiering or dismissal
combined with imprisonment which is carried out in a civil prison remains subject to AA until
he is received into a civil prison. The CO should enter on the discharge certificate the date of
admission into a civil prison as the date from which the dismissal takes effect, or in the case
of any officer, report the date of admission to the proper military authority.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 794:
5.
AA will apply to an offender who upon conviction by court-martial is sentenced to
imprisonment and committed to a civil prison, during the term of his imprisonment, through
he is cashiered or dismissed from the regular Army or otherwise has ceased to be subject to
AA and he may be kept, removed, imprisoned and punished as if he continued to be subject
of AA; see AA.s. 123 and noted thereto.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 795:
169.
Custody of Person under Sentence of Death.   When a person is sentenced by a court-
martial to suffer death, the commanding officer for the time being of such person may, if he thinks
fit, by a warrant in one of the forms in Appendix V, commit the said person for safe custody in a civil
prison pending confirmation or the carrying out of the sentence.

Chunk 805:
178.
Members of Court not to be Sworn or Affirmed.   The members of the court shall not be
sworn or affirmed, but when the court is a court of inquiry on recovered prisoners of war, the
members shall make the following declaration-
“I do declare upon my honour that I will duly and impartially inquire into and give
my opinion as to the circumstances in which …………………….. become a prisoner or war,
according to the true spirit and meaning of the regulations of the regular Army; and I do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk 806:
179.
Procedure.
(1)
The court shall be guided by the written instructions of the authority who assembled

(2)
The officer who assembled the court shall, when the court is held on a returned
prisoner of war or on a prisoner of war who is still absent, direct the court to record its
opinion whether the person concerned was taken prisoner through his own wilful neglect of
duty, or whether he served with or under, or aided the enemy; he shall also direct the court
to record its opinion in the case of a returned prisoner of war; whether he returned as soon
as possible to the service and in the case of a prisoner of war still absent whether he failed
to return to the service when it was possible for him to do so.  The officer who assembled
the court shall also record his own opinion on these points.

assembled in order to assist the authorities prescribed in AR 195(c) and 196, in determining
what remission of forfeiture of pay and allowances shall be ordered and what provision in
terms of AA.ss.98 and 99 shall be made for the dependants of such prisoner of war.  A

throughout the inquiry and of making any statement, and of giving any evidence he may wish to
make or give, and of cross-examining any witness whose evidence, in his opinion, affects his
character or military reputation and producing any witnesses in defence of his character and military
reputation.  The presiding officer of the court shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure
that any such person so affected and not previously notified receives notice of and fully understands
his rights, under this rule.
NOTE
Whenever it appears possible that the character or military reputation of a person
subject to AA may be affected as the result of the court of inquiry, the authority who
assembles the court of inquiry will take all necessary steps to secure that the provisions of
this rule are observed.  The ultimate responsibility of ensuring that they are observed in
every case will, however, rest upon the presiding officer of the court of inquiry, and should it
transpire during the sitting of the court that the character or military reputation of any
person subject to AA is affected by the evidence put forward, the presiding officer, will
immediately arrange for such person to be afforded the full facilities of the rule, adjourning
the court if necessary for the purpose of securing his attendance.
